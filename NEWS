Notmuch 0.32.2 (2021-06-27)
===========================

General
-------

Fix a bug from 2017 that can add duplicate thread-id terms to message
documents.

CLI
---

Fix small memory leak in notmuch new.

Emacs
-----

Add `(require 'seq)` for `seq-some`.

Documentation
-------------

Fix man page build for Sphinx 4.x. Fix variable name in emacs docs.

Tests
-----

Fix backup creation in `perf-test/T00-new`.  Check openssl
prerequisite in `add_gpgsm_home`.

Notmuch 0.32.1 (2021-05-15)
===========================

General
-------

Restore handling of relative values for `database.path` that was
broken by 0.32. Extend this handling to `database.mail_root`,
`database.backup_dir`, and `database.hook_dir`.

Reload certain metadata from Xapian database in
notmuch_database_reopen. This fixes a bug when adding messages to the
database in a pre-new hook.

Fix default of `$HOME/mail` for `database.path`. In release 0.32, this
default worked only in "notmuch config".

Emacs
-----

Restore the dynamically bound variables `tag-changes` and `query` in
in `notmuch-before-tag-hook` and `notmuch-after-tag-hook`.

Notmuch 0.32 (2021-05-02)
=========================

General
-------

This release includes a significant overhaul of the configuration
management facilities for notmuch.  The previous distinction between
configuration items that can be modified via plain text configuration
files and those that must be set in the database via the "notmuch
config" subcommand is gone, and all configuration items can be set in
both ways.  The external configuration file overrides configuration
items in the database. The location of database, hooks, and
configuration files is now more flexible, with several new
configuration variables. In particular XDG locations are now supported
as fallbacks for database, configuration and hooks. For more
information see `notmuch-config(1)`.

Library
-------

To support the new configuration facilities, several functions and
constants have been added to the notmuch API. Most notably:

- `notmuch_database_create_with_config`
- `notmuch_database_open_with_config`
- `notmuch_database_load_config`
- `notmuch_config_get`

A previously requested API change is that `notmuch_database_reopen` is
now exposed (and generalized).

The previously severe slowdowns from large numbers calls to
notmuch_database_remove_message or notmuch_message_delete in one
session has been fixed.

As always, the canonical source of API documentation is
`lib/notmuch.h`, or the doxygen formatted documentation in `notmuch(3)`

CLI
---

The `notmuch config set` subcommand gained a `--database` argument to
specify that the database should be updated, rather than a config file.

The speed of `notmuch new` and `notmuch reindex` in dealing with large
numbers of mail file deletions is significantly improved.

Emacs
-----

Completion related updates include: de-duplicating tags offered for
completion, use the actual initial input in address completion, allow
users to opt out of notmuch address completion, and do not force Ido
when prompting for senders.

Some keymaps used to contain bindings for unnamed commands.  These
lambda expressions have been replaced by named commands (symbols), to
ease customization.

Lexical binding is now used in all notmuch-emacs libraries.

Fix bug in calling `notmuch-mua-mail` with a non-nil RETURN-ACTION.

Removed, inlined or renamed functions and variables:
    `notmuch-address-locate-command`,
    `notmuch-documentation-first-line`, `notmuch-folder`,
    `notmuch-hello-trim', `notmuch-hello-versions` => `notmuch-version`,
    `notmuch-remove-if-not`, `notmuch-search-disjunctive-regexp`,
    `notmuch-sexp-eof`, `notmuch-split-content-type`, and
    `notmuch-tree-button-activate`.

Keymaps are no longer fset, which means they need to be referred to in
define-key directly (without quotes).  If your Emacs configuration has a
keybinding like:
   (define-key 'notmuch-show-mode-map "7" 'foo)
you should change it to:
   (define-key notmuch-show-mode-map "7" 'foo)

Notmuch 0.31.4 (2021-02-18)
===========================

Library
-------

Fix include bug triggered by glib 2.67.

Test
----

Fix race condition in T568-lib-thread.

Notmuch 0.31.3 (2020-12-25)
===========================

Bindings
--------

Fix for exclude tags in notmuch2 bindings.

Build
-----

Portability update for T360-symbol-hiding

Library
-------

Fix for memory error in notmuch_database_get_config_list

Notmuch 0.31.2 (2020-11-08)
===========================

Build
-----

Catch one more occurence of "version" in the build system, which
caused the file to be regenerated in the release tarball.

Notmuch 0.31.1 (2020-11-08)
===========================

Library
-------

Fix a memory initialization bug in notmuch_database_get_config_list.

Build
-----

Rename file 'version' to 'version.txt'. The old file name conflicted
with a C++ header for some compilers.

Replace use of coreutils `realpath` in configure.

Notmuch 0.31 (2020-09-05)
=========================

Emacs
-----

Notmuch now supports Emacs 27.1. You may need to set
`mml-secure-openpgp-sign-with-sender` and/or
`mml-secure-smime-sign-with-sender` to continue signing messages.

The minimum supported major version of GNU Emacs is now 25.1.

Add support for moving between threads after notmuch-tree-from-search-thread.

New `notmuch-unthreaded` mode (added in Notmuch 0.30)

  Unthreaded view is a mode where each matching message is shown on a
  separate line.

  The main key entries to unthreaded view are

  'u' enter a query to view in unthreaded mode (works in hello,
      search, show and tree mode)

  'U' view the current query in unthreaded mode (works from search,
      show and tree)

  Saved searches can also specify that they should open in unthreaded
  view.

  Currently it is not possible to specify the sort order: it will
  always be newest first.

Notmuch-Mutt
------------

The shell pipeline executed by notmuch-mutt, which symlinked matched
files to a maildir for mutt to access is replaced with internal perl
processing. This search operation is now more portable, and somewhat
faster.

Library
-------

Improve exception handling in the library. This should
largely eliminate terminations inside the library due to uncaught
exceptions or internal errors.  No doubt there are a few uncovered
code paths still; please report them as bugs.

Add `notmuch_message_get_flag_st` and
`notmuch_message_has_maildir_flag_st`, and deprecate the existing
non-status providing versions.

Move memory de-allocation from `notmuch_database_close` to
`notmuch_database_destroy`.

Handle relative filenames in `notmuch_database_index_file`, as
promised in the documentation.

Python Bindings
---------------

Documentation for the python bindings is merged into the main
sphinx-doc documentation tree. The merged documentation can be built
with e.g. `make sphinx-html`

Dependencies
------------

We now support building notmuch against Xapian 1.5 (the current
development version).

Test Suite
----------

Test suite fixes for compatibility with Emacs 27.1.

Build System
------------

Man pages are now compressed reproducibly.

Notmuch 0.30 (2020-07-10)
=========================

S/MIME
------

Handle S/MIME (PKCS#7) messages -- one-part signed messages, encrypted
messages, and multilayer messages. Treat them symmetrically to
OpenPGP messages. This includes handling protected headers
gracefully.

If you're using Notmuch with S/MIME, you currently need to configure
gpgsm appropriately.

Mixed-up MIME Repair
--------------------

Detect and automatically repair a common form of message mangling
created by Microsoft Exchange (see index.repaired=mixedup in
notmuch-properties(7)).

Protected Headers
-----------------

Avoid indexing the legacy-display part of an encrypted message that
has protected headers (see
index.repaired=skip-protected-headers-legacy-display in
notmuch-properties(7)).

Python
------

Drop support for python2, focus on python3.

Introduce new CFFI-based python bindings in the python module named
"notmuch2".  Officially deprecate (but still support) the older
"notmuch" module.

Dependencies
------------

Support for Xapian 1.2 is removed. The minimum supported version of
Xapian is now 1.4.0.

Notmuch 0.29.3 (2019-11-27)
===========================

General
-------

Fix for use-after-free in notmuch_config_list_{key,val}.

Fix for double close of file in notmuch-dump.

Debian
------

Drop python2 support from shipped debian packaging.

Notmuch 0.29.2 (2019-10-19)
===========================

General
-------

Fix for file descriptor leak when opening gzipped mail files. Thanks
to James Troup for the bug report and the fix.

Notmuch 0.29.1 (2019-06-11)
===========================

Build
-----

Fix for installation failure with `configure --without-emacs`.

Notmuch 0.29 (2019-06-07)
=========================

General
-------

Add "body:" field to allow searching for terms that occur only in the
message body. Users will need to reindex their mail to take advantage
of this feature.

Add support for indexing user specified headers (e.g. List-Id). See
notmuch-config(1) for details. This requires reindexing after changing
the set of headers to be indexed.

Fix bug for searching in some headers for Xapian keywords in quoted
strings.

Add support for gzip compressed mail messages (/not/ multi-message
mboxes); e.g. `gzip -9 $MAIL/archive/giant-message && notmuch new`
should work. Note that maildir flag syncing for gzipped messages is
currently untested.

Notmuch is now capable of indexing, searching and rendering
cryptographically-protected Subject: headers of the form produced by
Enigmail and K-9 mail in encrypted messages.

Command Line Interface
----------------------

`notmuch show` now supports --body=false and --include-html with
--format=text

Fix several performance problems with `notmuch reindex`.

`notmuch show` and `notmuch reply` now emit per-message cryptographic
status in their json and sexp output formats.  See devel/schemata for
more details about what is included there.  This status includes
information about cryptographic protections for the Subject header.

Emacs
-----

Optionally check for missing attachments in outgoing messages (see
function `notmuch-mua-attachment-check`).

Bind `B` to browse URLs in current message.

Bind `g` to refresh the current notmuch buffer.

Editing a message as new now includes an FCC header.

Forwarded messages are now tagged as +forwarded (customizable).

Add references header to link forwarded message to thread of original
message.

The minimum supported major version of Emacs is now 24.

Support for GNU Emacs older than 25.1 is deprecated with this release,
and may be removed in a future release.

Notmuch-emacs documentation is somewhat expanded. More contributions
are very welcome.

Build System
------------

Notmuch release tarballs are now compressed with `xz`.

We now provide conventional detached signatures of the release
tarballs in addition to the signed `sha256sum` files.

Dependencies
------------

Support for GMime 2.6 is removed. The minimum supported version of
GMime is now 3.0.3.  GMime also needs to have been compiled with
cryptography support.

Test Suite
----------

If either GNU parallel or moreutils parallel is installed, the tests
in the test suite will now be run in parallel (one per available
core).  This can be disabled with NOTMUCH_TEST_SERIALIZE=1.

Notmuch 0.28.4 (2019-05-05)
===========================

Command line interface
----------------------

Fix a spurious error when using `notmuch show --raw` on messages whose
size is a multiple of the internal buffer size.

Notmuch 0.28.3 (2019-03-05)
===========================

Library
-------

Fix a bug with the internal data structure _notmuch_string_map_t used
by message properties.

Build System
------------

Serialize calls to sphinx-build to avoid race condition.

Notmuch 0.28.2 (2019-02-17)
===========================

Emacs
-----

Invoke gpg with --batch and --no-tty.

Python Bindings
---------------

Fix documentation build with Python 3.7. Note that Python >= 3.3 is
now needed to build this documentation.

Notmuch 0.28.1 (2019-02-01)
===========================

Build System
------------

`configure` no longer uses the special variable BASH, as this causes
problems on systems where /bin/sh is bash.

Notmuch 0.28 (2018-10-12)
=========================

General
-------

Improve threading

  The threading algorithm has been updated to consider all references,
  not just the heuristically chosen parent (e.g. when that parent is
  not in the database). The heuristic for choosing a parent message
  has also been updated to again consider the In-Reply-To header, if
  it looks sensible. Re-indexing might be needed to take advantage of
  the latter change.

Handle mislabelled Windows-1252 parts

  Messages that contain Windows-1252 are apparently frequently
  mislabelled as ISO 8859-1. Use GMime functionality to apply the
  correct encoding for such messages.

Command Line Interface
----------------------

Support relative database paths

  Database paths (i.e. parameters to `notmuch config set
  database.path`) without a leading `/` are now interpreted relative
  to $HOME of the invoking user.

Emacs
-----

Improve stderr handling

  Add a real sentinel process to clean up stderr buffer. This is
  needed on e.g. macOS.

Call `notmuch-mua-send-hook` hooks when sending a message

  This hook was documented, but not functional for a very long time.

Completion
----------

The zsh completion has been updated to cover most of the notmuch
CLI. Internally it uses regexp searching, so needs at least Notmuch
0.24.

Build System
------------

The build system now installs notmuch-mutt and notmuch-emacs-mua with
absolute shebangs, following the conventions of most Linux
distributions.

Test Suite
----------

Fix certain tests that were failing with GMime 2.6. Users are reminded
that support for versions of GMime before 3.0.3 has been deprecated
since Notmuch 0.25.

Notmuch 0.27 (2018-06-13)
=========================

General
-------

Add support for thread:{} queries

  Queries of the form `thread:{foo} and thread:{bar}` match threads
  containing (possibly distinct) messages matching foo and bar. See
  `notmuch-search-terms(7)` for details.

Command Line Interface
----------------------

Add the --full-scan option to `notmuch new`

  This option disables mtime based optimization of scanning for new mail.

Add new --decrypt=stash option for `notmuch show`

  This facilitates a workflow for encrypted messages where message
  cleartext are indexed on first read, but the user's decryption key
  does not have to be available during message receipt.

Documentation
-------------

An initial manual for `notmuch-emacs` is now installed by default (in
`info` format).

Dependencies
------------

As of this release, support for versions of Xapian before 1.4.0 is
deprecated, and may disappear in a future release of notmuch.

Notmuch 0.26.2 (2018-04-28)
===========================

Library Changes
---------------

Work around Xapian bug with `get_mset(0,0, x)`

  This causes aborts in `_notmuch_query_count_documents` on
  e.g. Fedora 28.  The underlying bug is fixed in Xapian commit
  f92e2a936c1592, and will be fixed in Xapian 1.4.6.

Make thread indexing more robust against reference loops

  Choose a thread root by date in case of reference loops. Fix a
  related abort in `notmuch show`.

Notmuch 0.26.1 (2018-04-02)
===========================

Library Changes
---------------

Bump the library minor version. This should have happened in 0.26, but
better late than never.


Notmuch 0.26 (2018-01-09)
=========================

Command Line Interface
----------------------

Support for re-indexing existing messages

  There is a new subcommand, `notmuch reindex`, which re-indexes all
  messages matching supplied search terms.  This permits users to
  change the way specific messages are indexed.

  Note that for messages with multiple variants in the message
  archive, the recorded Subject: of may change upon reindexing,
  depending on the order in which the variants are indexed.

Improved error reporting in notmuch new

  Give more details when reporting certain Xapian exceptions.

Support maildir synced tags in `new.tags`

  Tags `draft`, `flagged`, `passed`, and `replied` are now supported
  in `new.tags`. The tag `unread` is still special in the presence of
  maildir syncing, and will be added for files in `new/` regardless of
  the setting of `new.tags`.

Support /regex/ in new.ignore

  Files and directories may be ignored based on regular expressions.

Allow `notmuch insert --folder=""`

  This inserts into the top level folder.

Strip trailing '/' from folder path for notmuch insert

  This prevents a potential problem with duplicated database records.

New option --output=address for notmuch address

Make `notmuch show` more robust against deleting duplicate files

The option --decrypt now takes an explicit argument

  The --decrypt option to `notmuch show` and `notmuch reply` now takes
  an explicit argument.  If you were used to invoking `notmuch show
  --decrypt`, you should switch to `notmuch show --decrypt=true`.

Boolean and keyword arguments now take a `--no-` prefix

Encrypted Mail
--------------

Indexing cleartext of encrypted e-mails

  It's now possible to include the cleartext of encrypted e-mails in
  the notmuch index.  This makes it possible to search your encrypted
  e-mails with the same ease as searching cleartext.  This can be done
  on a per-message basis by passing --decrypt=true to indexing
  commands (new, insert, reindex), or by default by running "notmuch
  config set index.decrypt true".

  Encrypted messages whose cleartext is indexed will typically also
  have their session keys stashed as properties associated with the
  message.  Stashed session keys permit rapid rendering of long
  encrypted threads, and disposal of expired encryption-capable keys.
  If for some reason you want cleartext indexing without stashed
  session keys, use --decrypt=nostash for your indexing commands (or
  run "notmuch config set index.decrypt nostash"). See `index.decrypt`
  in notmuch-config(1) for more details.

  Note that stashed session keys permit reconstruction of the
  cleartext of the encrypted message itself, and the contents of the
  index are roughly equivalent to the cleartext as well.  DO NOT USE
  this feature without considering the security of your index.

Emacs
-----

Guard against concurrent searches in notmuch-tree

Use make-process when available

  This allows newer Emacs to separate stdout and stderr from the
  notmuch command without using temporary files.

Library Changes
---------------

Indexing files with duplicate message-id

  Files with duplicate message-id's are now indexed, and searchable
  via terms and phrases. There are known issues related to
  presentation of results and regular-expression search, but in
  principle no mail file should be completely unsearchable now.

New functions to count files

  Two new functions in the libnotmuch API:
  `notmuch_message_count_files`, and `notmuch_thread_get_total_files`.

New function to remove properties

  A new function was added to the libnotmuch API to make it easier to
  drop all properties with a common pattern:
  `notmuch_message_remove_all_properties_with_prefix`

Change of return value of `notmuch_thread_get_authors`

  In certain corner cases, `notmuch_thread_get_authors` previously
  returned NULL.  This has been replaced by an empty string, since the
  possibility of NULL was not documented.

Transition `notmuch_database_add_message` to `notmuch_database_index_file`

  When indexing an e-mail message, the new
  `notmuch_database_index_file` function is the preferred form, and
  the old `notmuch_database_add_message` is deprecated.  The new form
  allows passing a set of options to the indexing engine, which the
  operator may decide to change from message to message.

Test Suite
----------

Out-of-tree builds

  The test suite now works properly with out-of-tree builds, i.e. with
  separate source and build directories. The --root option to tests
  has been dropped. The same can now be achieved more reliably using
  out-of-tree builds.

Python Bindings
---------------

Python bindings specific Debian packaging is removed

  The bindings have been build by the top level Debian packaging for a
  long time, and `bindings/python/debian` has bit-rotted.

Open mail files in binary mode when using Python 3

  This avoids certain encoding related crashes under Python 3.

Add python bindings for `notmuch_database_{get,set}_config*`

Optional `decrypt_policy` flag is available for notmuch.database().index_file()

nmbug
-----

nmbug's internal version increases to 0.3 in this notmuch release.
User-facing changes with this notmuch release:

* Accept failures to unset `core.worktree` in `clone`, which allows
  nmbug to be used with Git 2.11.0 and later.
* Auto-checkout in `clone` if it wouldn't clobber existing content,
  which makes the initial clone more convenient.
* Only error for invalid diff lines in `tags/`, which allows for
  `README`s and similar in nmbug repositories.

Documentation
-------------

New man page: notmuch-properties(7)

  This new page to the manual describes common conventions for how
  properties are used by libnotmuch, the CLI, and associated programs.
  External projects that use properties are encouraged to claim their
  properties and conventions here to avoid collisions.

Notmuch 0.25.3 (2017-12-08)
===========================

Emacs
-----

Extend mitigation (disabling handling x-display in text/enriched) for
Emacs bug #28350 to Emacs versions before 24.4 (i.e. without
`advice-add`).

Command Line Interface
----------------------

Correctly report userid validity. Fix test suite failure for GMime >=
3.0.3. This change raises the minimum supported version of GMime 3.x
to 3.0.3.

Notmuch 0.25.2 (2017-11-05)
===========================

Command Line Interface
----------------------

Fix segfault in notmuch-show crypto handling when compiled against
GMime 2.6; this was a regression in 0.25.

General
-------

Support for GMime before 3.0 is now deprecated, and will be removed in
a future release.

Notmuch 0.25.1 (2017-09-11)
===========================

Emacs
-----

Disable handling x-display in text/enriched messages. Mitigation for
Emacs bug #28350.

Notmuch 0.25 (2017-07-25)
=========================

General
-------

Add regexp searching for mid, paths, and tags.

Skip HTML tags when indexing

  In particular this avoids indexing large inline images.

Command Line Interface
----------------------

Bash completion is now installed to /usr/share by default.

Allow space as separator for keyword arguments.

Emacs
-----

Support for stashing message timestamp in show and tree views

  Invoking `notmuch-show-stash-date` with a prefix argument
  stashes the unix timestamp of the current message instead of
  the date string.

Don't use 'function' as variable name, workaround emacs bug 26406.

Library Changes
---------------

Add workaround for date parsing of bad input in older GMime

  In certain circumstances, older GMime libraries could return
  negative numbers when parsing syntactically invalid dates.

Replace deprecated functions with status returning versions

  API of notmuch_query_{search,count}_{messages,threads} has
  changed.  notmuch_query_add_tag_exclude now returns a status
  value.

Add support for building against GMime 3.0.

Rename libutil.a to libnotmuch_util.a.

libnotmuch SONAME is incremented to libnotmuch.so.5.

Notmuch 0.24.2 (2017-06-01)
===========================

Command Line Interface
----------------------

Fix output from `notmuch dump --include=properties` to not include tags.

Emacs
-----

Fix filename stashing in tree view.

Notmuch 0.24.1 (2017-04-01)
===========================

General
-------

Fix regressions in non-regexp search for `from:` and `subject:`

  The regexp search code in 0.24 introduced a regression in the
  handling of empty queries and wildcards. These are both corrected in
  this release.

Command Line Interface
----------------------

Fix several memory leaks in `notmuch show`

Update NEWS for 0.24 to mention schema changes

Fix bug in dump header

  The previous version of the dump header failed to mention the
  inclusion of tags. This fix bumps the version number of the dump
  format to 3. There are no other changes to the format.

Library Changes
---------------

Fix a read-after-free in the library.

Notmuch 0.24 (2017-03-12)
=========================

General
-------

Regular expression searches supported for `from:` and `subject:`

  This requires recent Xapian (1.4+) See notmuch-search-terms(7) for
  details.

Command Line Interface
----------------------

Run external `notmuch-` prefixed commands as subcommands

  You can now add your own `notmuch-` prefixed commands in PATH, and
  have notmuch run them as if they were notmuch commands. See the
  `notmuch(1)` man page for details

New default output format to 3

  See devel/schemata for details. Users of the structured output
  format are reminded of the `--format-version` argument to `notmuch
  show` and `notmuch search` which can prevent breakage when the
  default format changes.

Emacs
-----

Postpone and resume messages in `notmuch-message-mode` (composition)

  Notmuch now has built in support for postponing, saving and resuming
  messages. The default bindings are C-x C-s to save a draft, C-c C-p
  to postpone a draft (save and exit compose buffer), and "e" in show
  or tree view to resume.

  Draft messages are tagged with `notmuch-draft-tags` (draft by
  default) so you may wish to add that to the excluded tags list. When
  saving a previously saved draft message the earlier draft gets
  tagged deleted.

  Note that attachments added before postponing will be included as
  they were when you postponed in the final message.

Address Completion

  It is now possible to save the list of address completions for
  notmuch's internal completion between runs of emacs. This makes the
  first calls to address completion much better and faster. For
  privacy reasons it is disabled by default, to enable set or
  customize `notmuch-address-save-filename`.

Tag jump menu

  It is now possible to configure tagging shortcuts (with an interface
  like notmuch jump). For example (by default) k u will remove the
  unread tag, and k s will add a tag "spam" and remove the inbox
  tag. Pressing k twice will do the reverse operation so, for example,
  k k s removes the spam tag and adds the inbox tag. See the customize
  variable `notmuch-tagging-keys` for more information.

Refresh all buffers

  It is now possible to refresh all notmuch buffers to reflect the
  current state of the database with a single command, `M-=`.

Stop display of `application/*` parts

  By default gnus displays all `application/*` parts such as
  application/zip in the message buffer. This has several undesirable
  effects for notmuch (security, triggering errors etc). Notmuch now
  overrides this and does not display them by default. If you have
  customized `mm-inline-override-types` then we assume you know what
  you want and do not interfere; if you do want to stop the display of
  `application/*` add `application/*` to your customization. If you want
  to allow `application/*` then set `mm-inline-override-types` to
  "non/existent".

Small change in the api for notmuch-search-tag

  When `notmuch-search-tag` is called non-interactively and the region
  is set, then it only tags the threads in the region. (Previously it
  only tagged the current thread.)

Bugfix for sending messages with very long headers

  Previously emacs didn't fold very long headers when sending which
  could cause the MTA to refuse to send the message. This makes sure
  it does fold any long headers so the message is RFC compliant.

`notmuch emacs-mua` command installed with the Emacs interface

  We've carried a `notmuch-emacs-mua` script in the source tree for
  quite some time. It can be used to launch the Notmuch Emacs
  interface from the command line in many different ways. Starting
  with this release, it will be installed with the Emacs
  interface. With the new external subcommand support, the script
  transparently becomes a new notmuch command. See the
  `notmuch-emacs-mua(1)` man page for details.

Notmuch Emacs desktop integration

  The desktop integration file will now be installed with the Notmuch
  Emacs interface, adding a Notmuch menu item and configuration to
  allow the user to set up Notmuch Emacs as the `mailto:` URL handler.

Library changes
---------------

`notmuch_query_count_messages` is now non-destructive

  Internally the implementation of excludes has changed to make this
  possible.

Improved handling of DatabaseModifiedError

  Previously uncaught exceptions reading message metadata are now
  handled.

Notmuch 0.23.7 (2017-02-28)
===========================

Test Suite
----------

Drop use of gpgconf --create-socketdir. Move $GNUPGHOME to /tmp.

  It turns out the hardcoded use of /run/user in gpg doesn't work out
  that well in some environments. The more low tech fix is to move all
  of $GNUPGHOME to somewhere where we can control the length of the
  paths.

Notmuch 0.23.6 (2017-02-27)
===========================

Command Line Interface
----------------------

Fix read-after-free bug in `notmuch new`.

Test Suite
----------

Use gpgconf --create-socketdir if available.

  GnuPG has a facility to use sockets in /run or /var/run to avoid
  problems with long socket paths, but this is not enabled by default
  for GNUPGHOME other than $HOME/.gnupg. Enable it, if possible.

Notmuch 0.23.5 (2017-01-09)
===========================

Build system
------------

Fix quoting bug in configure. This had introduced a RUNPATH into the
notmuch binary in cases where it was not not needed.

Notmuch 0.23.4 (2016-12-24)
===========================

Command Line Interface
----------------------

Improve error handling in notmuch insert

  Database lock errors no longer prevent message file delivery to the
  filesystem.  Certain errors during `notmuch insert` most likely to
  be temporary return EX_TEMPFAIL.

Emacs
-----

Restore autoload cookie for notmuch-search.

Notmuch 0.23.3 (2016-11-27)
===========================

Command Line Interface
----------------------

Treat disappearing files during notmuch new as non-fatal.

Test Suite
----------

Fix incompatibility (related to signature size) with gnupg 2.1.16.

Notmuch 0.23.2 (2016-11-20)
===========================

Emacs
-----

Fix notmuch-interesting-buffer and notmuch-cycle-notmuch-buffers.

  notmuch-tree-mode and notmuch-message-mode buffers are now
  considered interesting by `notmuch-interesting-buffer` and
  `notmuch-cycle-notmuch-buffers`.

Restore compatibility with Emacs 23.

  Notmuch support for Emacs 23 is now deprecated.

Notmuch 0.23.1 (2016-10-23)
===========================

General
-------

Require Xapian >= 1.2.6

  The ifdef branch for older Xapian (pre-compact API) had bit-rotted.

Emacs
-----

Fix default colours for unread and flagged messages

  In 0.23 the default colours for unread and flagged messages in
  search view were accidentally swapped. This release returns them to
  the original colours.

  A related change in 0.23 broke the customize widget for
  notmuch-search-line-faces. This is now fixed.

Fix test failure with Emacs 25.1

  A previously undiscovered jit-lock related bug was exposed by Emacs
  25, causing a notmuch-show mode test to fail. This release fixes the
  bug, and hence the test.

Notmuch 0.23 (2016-10-03)
=========================

General (Xapian 1.4+)
---------------------

Compiling against Xapian 1.4 enables several new features.

Support for single argument date: queries

  `date:<expr>` is equivalent to `date:<expr>..<expr>`.

Support for blocking opens

  When opening a database notmuch by default will wait for another
  process to release a write lock, rather than returning an error.

Support for named queries

  Named queries (also known as 'saved searches') can be defined with a
  `query:name` format. The expansion of these queries is stored in the
  database and they can be used from any notmuch client.

Library
-------

Message property API

  libnotmuch now supports the attachment of arbitrary key-value pairs
  to messages. These can be used by various tools to manage their
  private data without polluting the user tag space. They also support
  iteration of values with the same key or same key prefix.

Bug fix for `notmuch_directory_set_mtime`

  Update cached mtime to match on-disk mtime.

CLI
---

Support for compile time options

  A group of `built_with` keys is now supported for notmuch
  config. Initial keys in this group are `compact`, `field_processor`,
  and `retry_lock`.

Dump/Restore support for configuration information and properties

  Any configuration information stored in the database (initially just
  named queries) is dumped and restored. Similarly any properties
  attached to messages are also dumped and restored. Any new
  information in the dump format is prefixed by '#' to allow existing
  scripts to ignore it.

Emacs
-----

Make notmuch-message-mode use insert for fcc

  Notmuch-message-mode now defaults to using notmuch insert for
  fcc. The old file based fcc behaviour can be restored by setting the
  defcustom `notmuch-maildir-use-notmuch-insert` to nil.

  When using notmuch insert, `notmuch-fcc-dirs` must be a subdirectory
  of the mailstore (absolute paths are not permitted) followed by any
  tag changes to be applied to the inserted message. The tag changes
  are applied after the default tagging for new messages. For example
  setting the header to "sentmail -inbox +sent" would insert the
  message in the subdirectory sentmail of the mailstore, add the tag
  "sent", and not add the (normally added) "inbox" tag.

  Finally, if the insert fails (e.g. if the database is locked) the
  user is presented with the option to retry, ignore, or edit the
  header.

Make internal address completion customizable

  There is a new defcustom `notmuch-address-internal-completion` which
  controls how the internal completion works: it allows the user to
  choose whether to match on messages the user sent, or the user
  received, and to filter the messages used for the match, for example
  by date.

Allow internal address completion on an individual basis

  There is a new function `notmuch-address-toggle-internal-completion`
  (by default it has no keybinding) which allows users who normally
  use an external completion command to use the builtin internal
  completion for the current buffer.

  Alternatively, if the user has company-mode enabled, then the user
  can use company mode commands such as `company-complete` to
  activate the builtin completion for an individual completion.

Resend messages

  The function `notmuch-show-resend-message` (bound to `b` in show
  and tree modes) will (attempt to) send current message to new
  recipients. The headers of the message won't be altered (e.g. `To:`
  may point to yourself). New `Resent-To:`, `Resent-From:` and so on
  will be added instead.

Face customization is easier

  New faces `notmuch-tag-unread`, `notmuch-tag-flagged`,
  `notmuch-tag-deleted`, `notmuch-tag-added`,
  `notmuch-search-flagged-face` and `notmuch-search-unread-face` are
  now used by default. Customize `notmuch-faces` to modify them.

Omit User-Agent header by default when sending mail

Ruby Bindings
-------------

Add support for `notmuch_database_get_all_tags`

Go Bindings
-----------

Go bindings moved to contrib

Add support for `notmuch_threads_t` and `notmuch_thread_t`

Fixed constant values so they are not all zero anymore

  Previously, it was impossible to open writable database handles,
  because `DATABASE_MODE_READ_ONLY` and `DATABASE_MODE_READ_WRITE` were
  both set to zero.
  The same issue occurred with sort modes.

Notmuch 0.22.2 (2016-09-08)
===========================

Test Suite
----------

Silence gdb more

  Have gdb write to a log file instead of stdout, hiding some more
  (harmless) stderr chatter which causes test failures.

Hardcode fingerprint in PGP/MIME tests

  Make the tests more robust against changing GnuPG output formats.

Notmuch 0.22.1 (2016-07-19)
===========================

Library
-------

Correct the definition of `LIBNOTMUCH_CHECK_VERSION`.

Document the (lack of) operations permitted on a closed database.

Test Suite
----------

Fix race condition in dump / restore tests.

Notmuch-Mutt
------------

Use `env` to locate perl.

Emacs
-----

Tell `message-mode` mode that outgoing messages are mail

  This makes message-mode configuration behave more predictably.

Respect charset of MIME parts when reading them

  Fix previous assumption that everyone uses UTF-8.

Notmuch 0.22 (2016-04-26)
=========================

General
-------

Xapian 1.3 support

  Notmuch should now build (and the test suite should pass) on recent
  releases of Xapian 1.3.x. It has been tested with Xapian 1.3.5.

Limited support for S/MIME messages

  Signature verification is supported, but not decryption. S/MIME
  signature creation and S/MIME encryption are supported via built-in
  support in Emacs. S/MIME support is not extensively tested at this
  time.

Bug Fixes

   Fix for threading bug involving deleting and re-adding
   messages. Fix for case-sensitive content disposition headers. Fix
   handling of 1 character directory names at top level.

Command Line Interface
----------------------

`notmuch show` now supports verifying S/MIME signatures

  This support relies on an appropriately configured `gpgsm`.

Build System
------------

Drop dependency on "pkg-config emacs".

Emacs Interface
---------------

Notmuch replies now include all parts shown in the show view

  There are two main user visible changes. The first is that rfc822
  parts are now included in replies.

  The second change is that part headers are now included in the reply
  buffer to provide visible separation of the parts. The choice of
  which part headers to show is customizable via the variable
  `notmuch-mua-reply-insert-header-p-function`.

Filtering or Limiting messages is now bound to `l` in the search view

  This binding now matches the analogous binding in show view.

`F` forwards all open messages in a thread

  When viewing a thread of messages, the new binding `F` can be used
  to generate a new outgoing message which forwards all of the open
  messages in the thread. This is analogous to the `f` binding, which
  forwards only the current message.

Preferred content type can be determined from the message content

  More flexibility in choosing which sub-part of a
  multipart/alternative part is initially shown is available by
  setting `notmuch-multipart/alternative-discouraged` to a function
  that returns a list of discouraged types. The function so specified
  is passed the message as an argument and can examine the message
  content to determine which content types should be discouraged. This
  is in addition to the current capabilities (i.e. setting
  `notmuch-multipart/alternative-discouraged` to a list of discouraged
  types).

When viewing a thread ("show" mode), queries that match no messages no
longer generate empty buffers

  Should an attempt be made to view the thread corresponding to a
  query that matches no messages, a warning message is now displayed
  and the terminal bell rung rather than displaying an empty buffer
  (or, in some cases, displaying an empty buffer and throwing an
  error). This also affects re-display of the current thread.

Handle S/MIME signatures in emacs

  The emacs interface is now capable making and verifying S/MIME
  signatures.

`notmuch-message-address-insinuate` is now a no-op

  This reduces the amount of interference with non-notmuch uses of
  message-mode.

Address completion improvements

  An external script is no longer needed for address completion; if
  you previously configured one, customize the variable
  `notmuch-address-command` to try the internal completion. If
  `company-mode` is available, notmuch uses it by default for
  interactive address completion.

Test and experiment with the emacs MUA available in source tree

  `./devel/try-emacs-mua` runs emacs and fills the window with
  information how to try the MUA safely. Emacs is configured to use
  the notmuch (lisp) files located in `./emacs` directory.

Documentation
-------------

New `notmuch-report(1)` and `notmuch-report.json(5)` man pages
describe `notmuch-report` and its JSON configuration file.  You can
build these files by running `make` in the `devel/nmbug/doc`
directory.

notmuch-report
--------------

Renamed from `nmbug-status`.  This script generates reports based on
notmuch queries, and doesn't really have anything to do with nmbug,
except for sharing the `NMBGIT` environment variable.  The new name
focuses on the script's action, instead of its historical association
with the nmbug workflow.  This should make it more discoverable for
users looking for generic notmuch reporting tools.

The default configuration file name (extracted from the `config`
branch of `NBMGIT` has changed from `status-config.json` to
`notmuch-report.json` so it is more obviously associated with the
report-generating script.  The configuration file also has a new
`meta.message-url` setting, which is documented in
`notmuch-report.json(5)`.

`notmuch-report` now wraps query phrases in parentheses when and-ing
them together, to avoid confusion about clause grouping.

Notmuch 0.21 (2015-10-29)
=========================

General
-------

Notmuch now requires gmime >= 2.6.7. The gmime 2.4 series is no longer
supported.

Database revision tracking: `lastmod:` queries

  Each message now has a metadata revision number that increases with
  every tagging operation. See the discussion of `lastmod:` in
  `notmuch-search-terms(7)` for more information.

Date queries now support `date:<expr>..!` shorthand for
`date:<expr>..<expr>`

  You can use, for example, `date:yesterday..!` to match from the
  beginning of yesterday to the end of yesterday. For further details,
  please refer to the `notmuch-search-terms` manual page.

Notmuch database upgrade to support `lastmod:` queries

  The above mentioned `lastmod:` prefix. This will be done
  automatically, without prompting on the next time `notmuch new` is
  run after the upgrade. The upgrade is not reversible, and the
  upgraded database will not be readable by older versions of
  Notmuch. As a safeguard, a database dump will be created in the
  `.notmuch` directory before upgrading.

Build System
------------

The ruby bindings are now built as part of the main notmuch build
process. This can be disabled with the `--without-ruby` option to
configure.

Building the documentation can be disabled with the `--without-docs`
option to configure.

Skipped individual tests are no longer considered as failures.

Command Line Interface
----------------------

Database revision tracking

  Two new options were added to support revision tracking. A global
  option "--uuid" (`notmuch(1)`) was added for to detect counter
  rollover and reinitialization, and `notmuch-count(1)` gained a
  `--lastmod` option to query database revision tracking data.

The `notmuch address` command supports new deduplication schemes

  `notmuch address` has gained a new `--deduplicate` option to specify
  how the results should be deduplicated, if at all. The alternatives
  are `no` (do not deduplicate, useful for processing the results with
  external tools), `mailbox` (deduplicate based on the full, case
  sensitive name and email address), and `address` (deduplicate based
  on the case insensitive address part). See the `notmuch-address`
  manual page for further information.

Emacs Interface
---------------

`notmuch-emacs-version` is used in `User-Agent` header

  The value of recently introduced variable `notmuch-emacs-version` is
  now used as a part of `User-Agent` header when sending emails.

Removed `notmuch-version` function by renaming it to `notmuch-cli-version`

  With existing variable `notmuch-emacs-version` the accompanied
  function which retrieves the version of `notmuch-command` is
  better named as `notmuch-cli-version`.

Query input now supports completion for "is:<tag>"

New message composition mode: `notmuch-compose-mode`

  This is mainly to fix fcc handling, but may be useful for user
  customization as well.

Allow filtering of search results in `notmuch-show`

Add function to rerun current tree-view search in search mode

Bug fix for replying to encrypted messages in `notmuch-tree` mode

Allow saved searched to specify tree view rather than search view

  Applies to saved searches run from `notmuch-hello`, or by a keyboard
  shortcut (`notmuch-jump`).  Can be set in the customize interface, or
  by adding :search-type tree to the appropriate saved search plist in
  `notmuch-saved-searches`.

Increase maximum size of rendered text parts

  The variable `notmuch-show-max-text-part-size` controls the maximum
  size (in bytes) which is automatically rendered. This may make
  rendering large threads slower. To get the previous behaviour set
  this variable to 10000.

Library
-------

The use of absolute paths is now enforced when calling
`notmuch_database_{open, create}`

New function `notmuch_directory_delete` to delete directory documents

  Previously there was no way to delete directory documents from the
  database, leading to confusing results when the "ghost" directory
  document of a renamed or deleted filesystem directory was
  encountered every time the parent directory was being scanned by
  `notmuch new`. The mtime of the old directory document was also used
  if a directory by the same name was added again in the filesystem,
  potentially bypassing the scan for the directory. The issues are
  fixed by providing a library call to delete directory documents, and
  deleting the old documents in `notmuch new` on filesystem directory
  removal or rename.

Database revision tracking

  Revision tracking is supported via a new prefix "lastmod:" in the
  query parser and the new function
  `notmuch_database_get_revision`. For the latter, see `notmuch(3)`.

New status code returning API for n_query_count_{messages,threads}

Deprecated functions

  `notmuch_query_search_threads`, `notmuch_query_search_messages`,
  `notmuch_query_count_messages`, and `notmuch_query_count_threads`
  are all deprecated as of this release.  Clients are encouraged to
  transition to the `_st` variants supporting better error reporting.

nmbug-status
------------

`nmbug-status` now supports specifying the sort order for each view.

Notmuch 0.20.2 (2015-06-27)
===========================

Emacs Interface
---------------

Bug fix for marking messages read in `notmuch-tree` mode.

Notmuch 0.20.1 (2015-06-01)
===========================

Test Suite
----------

Work around apparent gdb bug on arm64.

Notmuch 0.20 (2015-05-31)
=========================

Command-Line Interface
----------------------

There is a new `mimetype:` search prefix

  The new `mimetype:` search prefix allows searching for the
  content-type of attachments, which is now indexed. See the
  `notmuch-search-terms` manual page for details.

Path to gpg is now configurable

  On systems with multiple versions of gpg, you can tell
  notmuch which one to use by setting `crypto.gpg_path`

Emacs
-----

Avoid rendering large text attachments.

Improved rendering of CID references in HTML.

Vim
---

Vim client now respects excluded tags.

Notmuch-Mutt
------------

Support messages without Message-IDs.

Library
-------

Undeprecate single message mboxes

  It seems more trouble to remove this feature than expected, so
  `notmuch new` will no longer nag about mboxes with a single message.

New error logging facility

  Clients should call `notmuch_database_status_string` to retrieve
  output formerly printed to stderr.

Several bug fixes related to stale iterators

New status code returning API for n_query_search_{messages,thread}

Fix for library `install_name` on Mac OS X

Fix for rounding of seconds

Documentation
-------------

Sphinx is now mandatory to build docs

  Support for using rst2man in place of sphinx to build the
  documentation has been removed.

Improved notmuch-search-terms.7

  The man page `notmuch-search-terms(7)` has been extended, merging
  some material from the relicensed wiki.

Contrib
-------

`notmuch-deliver` is removed. As far as we know, all functionality
previously provided by `notmuch-deliver` should now be provided by
`notmuch insert`, provided by the main notmuch binary.

nmbug-status
------------

`nmbug-status` now only matches local branches when reading
`status-config.json` from the `config` branch of the `NMBGIT`
repository.  To help new users running `nmbug-status`, `nmbug clone`
now creates a local `config` branch tracking `origin/config`.  Folks
who use `nmbug-status` with an in-Git config (i.e. you don't use the
`--config` option) who already have `NMBGIT` set up are encouraged to
run:

    git checkout config origin/config

in their `NMBGIT` repository (usually `~/.nmbug`).

Notmuch 0.19 (2014-11-14)
=========================

Overview
--------

This release improves the reliability of `notmuch dump` and the error
handling for `notmuch insert`. The new `notmuch address` command is
intended to make searching for email addresses more convenient. At the
library level the revised handling of missing messages fixes at least
one bug in threading. The release also includes several interface
improvements to the emacs interface, most notably the ability to bind
keyboard shortcuts to saved searches.

Command-Line Interface
----------------------

Stopped `notmuch dump` failing if someone writes to the database

  The dump command now takes the write lock when running. This
  prevents other processes from writing to the database during the
  dump which would cause the dump to fail. Note, if another notmuch
  process already has the write lock the dump will not start, so
  script callers should still check the return value.

`notmuch insert` requires successful message indexing for success status

  Previously the `notmuch insert` subcommand indicated success even if
  the message indexing failed, as long as the message was delivered to
  file system. This could have lead to delivered messages missing
  tags, etc. `notmuch insert` is now more strict, also requiring
  successful indexing for success status. Use the new `--keep` option
  to revert to the old behaviour (keeping the delivered message file
  and returning success even if indexing fails).

`notmuch insert` has gained support for `post-insert` hook

  The new `post-insert` hook is run after message delivery, similar to
  `post-new`. There's also a new option `notmuch insert --no-hooks` to
  skip the hook. See the notmuch-hooks(1) man page for details.

`notmuch deliver` is deprecated

  With this release we believe that `notmuch insert` has reached
  parity with `notmuch deliver`. We recommend that all users of
  `notmuch deliver` switch to `notmuch insert` as the former is
  currently unmaintained.

`notmuch search` now supports `--duplicate=N` option with `--output=messages`

  Complementing the `notmuch search --duplicate=N --output=files`
  options, the new `--duplicate=N --output=messages` combination
  limits output of message IDs to messages matching search terms that
  have at least `N` files associated with them.

Added `notmuch address` subcommand

  This new subcommand searches for messages matching the given search
  terms, and prints the addresses from them. Duplicate addresses are
  filtered out. The `--output` option controls which of the following
  information is printed: sender addresses, recipient addresses and
  count of duplicate addresses.

Emacs Interface
---------------

Use the `j` key to access saved searches from anywhere in notmuch

  `j` is now globally bound to `notmuch-jump`, which provides fast,
  interactive keyboard shortcuts to saved searches.  For example,
  with the default saved searches `j i` from anywhere in notmuch will
  bring up the inbox.

Improved handling of the unread tag

  Notmuch now marks an open message read (i.e., removes the unread
  tag) if point enters the message at any time in a show buffer
  regardless of how point got there (mouse click, cursor command, page
  up/down, notmuch commands such as n,N etc). This fixes various
  anomalies or bugs in the previous handling. Additionally it is
  possible to customize the mark read handling by setting
  `notmuch-show-mark-read-function` to a custom function.

Expanded default saved search settings

  The default saved searches now include several more common searches,
  as well as shortcut keys for `notmuch-jump`.

Improved `q` binding in notmuch buffers

  `q` will now bury rather than kill a notmuch search, show or tree
  buffer if there are multiple windows showing the buffer. If only a
  single window is showing the buffer, it is killed.

`notmuch-show-stash-mlarchive-link-alist` now supports functions

  Some list archives may use a more complicated scheme for referring
  to messages than just concatenated URL and message ID. For example,
  patchwork requires a query to translate message ID to a patchwork
  patch ID. `notmuch-show-stash-mlarchive-link-alist` now supports
  functions to better cover such cases. See the help documentation for
  the variable for details.

Library changes
---------------

Introduced database version 3 with support for "database features."

  Features are independent aspects of the database schema.
  Representing these independently of the database version number will
  let us evolve the database format faster and more incrementally,
  while maintaining better forwards and backwards compatibility.

Library users are no longer required to call `notmuch_database_upgrade`

  Previously, library users were required to call
  `notmuch_database_needs_upgrade` and `notmuch_database_upgrade`
  before using a writable database.  Even the CLI didn't get this
  right, and it is no longer required.  Now, individual APIs may
  return `NOTMUCH_STATUS_UPGRADE_REQUIRED` if the database format is
  too out of date for that API.

Library users can now abort an atomic section by closing the database

  Previously there was no supported way to abort an atomic section.
  Callers can now simply close the database, and any outstanding
  atomic section will be aborted.

Add return status to `notmuch_database_close` and
`notmuch_database_destroy`

Bug fixes and performance improvements for thread linking

  The database now represents missing-but-referenced messages ("ghost
  messages") similarly to how it represents regular messages.  This
  enables an improved thread linking algorithm that performs better
  and fixes a bug that sometimes prevented notmuch from linking
  messages into the same thread.

nmbug
-----

The Perl script has been translated to Python; you'll need Python 2.7
or anything from the 3.x line.  Most of the user-facing interface is
the same, but `nmbug help` is now `nmbug --help`, and the following nmbug
commands have slightly different interfaces: `archive`, `commit`,
`fetch`, `log`, `pull`, `push`, and `status`.  For details on the
new interface for a given command, run `nmbug COMMAND --help`.

nmbug-status
------------

`nmbug-status` can now optionally load header and footer templates
from the config file.  Use something like:

    {
      "meta": {
        "header": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang="en">\n...",
        "footer": "</body></html>",
         ...
      },
      ...
    }

Python Bindings
---------------

Add support for `notmuch_query_add_tag_exclude`

Build System
------------

The notmuch binaries and libraries are now build with debugging symbols
by default.  Users concerned with disk space should change the
defaults when configuring or use the strip(1) command.

Notmuch 0.18.2 (2014-10-25)
===========================

Test Suite
----------

Translate T380-atomicity to use gdb/python

  The new version is compatible with gdb 7.8

Emacs 24.4 related bug fixes

  The Messages buffer became read-only, and the generated mime
  structure for signatures changed slightly.

Simplify T360-symbol-hiding

   Replace the use of `objdump` on the object files with `nm` on the
   resulting lib.

Notmuch 0.18.1 (2014-06-25)
===========================

This is a bug fix and portability release.

Build System
------------

Add a workaround for systems without zlib.pc

Make emacs install robust against the non-existence of emacs

Put notmuch lib directory first in RPATH

Fix handling of `html_static_path` in sphinx

  Both the python bindings and the main docs had spurious settings of
  this variable.

Test Suite
----------

Use --quick when starting emacs

  This avoids a hang in the T160-json tests.

Allow pending break points in atomicity script

  This allows the atomicity tests to run on several more architectures/OSes.

Command-Line Interface
----------------------

To improve portability use fsync instead of fdatasync in
`notmuch-dump`. There should be no functional difference.

Library changes
---------------

Resurrect support for single-message mbox files

  The removal introduced a bug with previously indexed single-message
  mboxes.  This support remains deprecated.

Fix for phrase indexing

  There were several bugs where words intermingled from different
  headers and MIME parts could match a single phrase query.  This fix
  will affect only newly indexed messages.

Emacs Interface
---------------

Make sure tagging on an empty query is harmless

  Previously tagging an empty query could lead to tags being
  unintentionally removed.

Notmuch 0.18 (2014-05-06)
=========================

Overview
--------

This new release includes some enhancements to searching for messages
by filesystem location (`folder:` and `path:` prefixes under *General*
below).  Saved searches in *Emacs* have also been enhanced to allow
distinct search orders for each one.  Another enhancement to the
*Emacs* interface is that replies to encrypted messages are now
encrypted, reducing the risk of unintentional information disclosure.
The default dump output format has changed to the more robust
`batch-tag` format. The previously deprecated parsing of single
message mboxes has been removed. For detailed release notes, see
below.

General
-------

The `folder:` search prefix now requires an exact match

  The `folder:` prefix has been changed to search for email messages
  by the exact, case sensitive maildir or MH folder name. Wildcard
  matching (`folder:foo*`) is no longer supported. The new behaviour
  allows for more accurate mail folder based searches, makes it
  possible to search for messages in the top-level folder, and should
  lead to less surprising results than the old behaviour. Users are
  advised to see the `notmuch-search-terms` manual page for details,
  and review how the change affects their existing `folder:` searches.

There is a new `path:` search prefix

  The new `path:` search prefix complements the `folder:` prefix. The
  `path:` prefix searches for email messages that are in particular
  directories within the mail store, optionally recursively using a
  special syntax. See the `notmuch-search-terms` manual page for
  details.

Notmuch database upgrade due to `folder:` and `path:` changes

  The above mentioned changes to the `folder:` prefix and the addition
  of `path:` prefix require a Notmuch database upgrade. This will be
  done automatically, without prompting on the next time `notmuch new`
  is run after the upgrade. The upgrade is not reversible, and the
  upgraded database will not be readable by older versions of
  Notmuch. As a safeguard, a database dump will be created in the
  `.notmuch` directory before upgrading.

Library changes
---------------

Notmuch database upgrade

  The libnotmuch consumers are reminded to handle database upgrades
  properly, either by relying on running `notmuch new`, or checking
  `notmuch_database_needs_upgrade()` and calling
  `notmuch_database_upgrade()` as necessary. This has always been the
  case, but in practise there have been no database upgrades in any
  released version of Notmuch before now.

Support for indexing mbox files has been dropped

  There has never been proper support for mbox files containing
  multiple messages, and the support for single-message mbox files has
  been deprecated since Notmuch 0.15. The support has now been
  dropped, and all mbox files will be rejected during indexing.

Message header parsing changes

  Notmuch previously had an internal parser for message headers. The
  parser has now been dropped in favour of letting GMime parse both
  the headers and the message MIME structure at the same pass. This is
  mostly an internal change, but the GMime parser is stricter in its
  interpretation of the headers. This may result in messages with
  slightly malformed message headers being now rejected.

Command-Line Interface
----------------------

`notmuch dump` now defaults to `batch-tag` format

  The old format is still available with `--format=sup`.

`notmuch new` has a --quiet option

  This option suppresses the progress and summary reports.

`notmuch insert` respects maildir.synchronize_flags config option

  Do not synchronize tags to maildir flags in `notmuch insert` if the
  user does not want it.

The commands set consistent exit status codes on failures

  The cli commands now consistently set exit status of 1 on failures,
  except where explicitly otherwise noted. The notable exceptions are
  the status codes for format version mismatches for commands that
  support formatted output.

Bug fix for checking configured new.tags for invalid tags

  `notmuch new` and `notmuch insert` now check the user configured
  new.tags for invalid tags, and refuse to apply them, similar to
  `notmuch tag`. Invalid tags are currently the empty string and tags
  starting with `-`.

Emacs Interface
---------------

Init file

  If the file pointed by new variable `notmuch-init-file` (typically
  `~/.emacs.d/notmuch-config.el`) exists, it is loaded at the end of
  `notmuch.el`. Users can put their personal notmuch emacs lisp based
  configuration/customization items there instead of filling
  `~/.emacs` with these.

Changed format for saved searches

  The format for `notmuch-saved-searches` has changed, but old style
  saved searches are still supported. The new style means that a saved
  search can store the desired sort order for the search, and it can
  store a separate query to use for generating the count notmuch
  shows.

  The variable is fully customizable and any configuration done
  through customize should *just work*, with the additional options
  mentioned above. For manual customization see the documentation for
  `notmuch-saved-searches`.

  IMPORTANT: a new style notmuch-saved-searches variable will break
  previous versions of notmuch-emacs (even search will not work); to
  fix remove the customization for notmuch-saved-searches.

  If you have a custom saved search sort function (not unsorted or
  alphabetical) then the sort function will need to be
  modified. Replacing (car saved-search) by (notmuch-saved-search-get
  saved-search :name) and (cdr saved-search) by
  (notmuch-saved-search-get saved-search :query) should be sufficient.

The keys of `notmuch-tag-formats` are now regexps

  Previously, the keys were literal strings.  Customized settings of
  `notmuch-tag-formats` will continue to work as before unless tags
  contain regexp special characters like `.` or `*`.

Changed tags are now shown in the buffer

  Previously tag changes made in a buffer were shown immediately. In
  some cases (particularly automatic tag changes like marking read)
  this made it hard to see what had happened (e.g., whether the
  message had been unread).

  The changes are now shown explicitly in the buffer: by default
  deleted tags are displayed with red strike-through and added tags
  are displayed underlined in green (inverse video is used for deleted
  tags if the terminal does not support strike-through).

  The variables `notmuch-tag-deleted-formats` and
  `notmuch-tag-added-formats`, which have the same syntax as
  `notmuch-tag-formats`, allow this to be customized.

  Setting `notmuch-tag-deleted-formats` to `'((".*" nil))` and
  `notmuch-tag-added-formats` to `'((".*" tag))` will give the old
  behavior of hiding deleted tags and showing added tags identically
  to tags already present.

Version variable

  The new, build-time generated variable `notmuch-emacs-version` is used
  to distinguish between notmuch cli and notmuch emacs versions.
  The function `notmuch-hello-versions` (bound to 'v' in notmuch-hello
  window) prints both notmuch cli and notmuch emacs versions in case
  these differ from each other.
  This is especially useful when using notmuch remotely.

Ido-completing-read initialization in Emacs 23

  `ido-completing-read` in Emacs 23 versions 1 through 3 freezes unless
  it is initialized. Defadvice-based *Ido* initialization is defined
  for these Emacs versions.

Bug fix for saved searches with newlines in them

  Split lines confuse `notmuch count --batch`, so we remove embedded
  newlines before calling notmuch count.

Bug fixes for sender identities

  Previously, Emacs would rewrite some sender identities in unexpected
  and undesirable ways.  Now it will use identities exactly as
  configured in `notmuch-identities`.

Replies to encrypted messages will be encrypted by default

  In the interest of maintaining confidentiality of communications,
  the Notmuch Emacs interface now automatically adds the mml tag to
  encrypt replies to encrypted messages. This should make it less
  likely to accidentally reply to encrypted messages in plain text.

Reply pushes mark before signature

  We push mark and set point on reply so that the user can easily cut
  the quoted text. The mark is now pushed before the signature, if
  any, instead of end of buffer so the signature is preserved.

Message piping uses the originating buffer's working directory

  `notmuch-show-pipe-message` now uses the originating buffer's
  current default directory instead of that of the `*notmuch-pipe*`
  buffer's.

nmbug
-----

nmbug adds a `clone` command for setting up the initial repository and
uses `@{upstream}` instead of `FETCH_HEAD` to track upstream changes.

  The `@{upstream}` change reduces ambiguity when fetching multiple
  branches, but requires existing users update their `NMBGIT`
  repository (usually `~/.nmbug`) to distinguish between local and
  remote-tracking branches.  The easiest way to do this is:

  1. If you have any purely local commits (i.e. they aren't in the
     nmbug repository on nmbug.tethera.net), push them to a remote
     repository.  We'll restore them from the backup in step 4.
  2. Remove your `NMBGIT` repository (e.g. `mv .nmbug .nmbug.bak`).
  3. Use the new `clone` command to create a fresh clone:

        nmbug clone https://nmbug.notmuchmail.org/git/nmbug-tags.git

  4. If you had local commits in step 1, add a remote for that
     repository and fetch them into the new repository.

Notmuch 0.17 (2013-12-30)
=========================

Incompatible change in SHA1 computation
---------------------------------------

Previously on big endian architectures like sparc and powerpc the
computation of SHA1 hashes was incorrect. This meant that messages
with overlong or missing message-ids were given different computed
message-ids than on more common little endian architectures like i386
and amd64.  If you use notmuch on a big endian architecture, you are
strongly advised to make a backup of your tags using `notmuch dump`
before this upgrade. You can locate the affected files using something
like:

    notmuch dump | \
      awk '/^notmuch-sha1-[0-9a-f]{40} / \
        {system("notmuch search --exclude=false --output=files id:" $1)}'

Command-Line Interface
----------------------

New options to better support handling duplicate messages

  If more than one message file is associated with a message-id,
  `notmuch search --output=files` will print all of them. A new
  `--duplicate=N` option can be used to specify which duplicate to
  print for each message.

  `notmuch count` now supports `--output=files` option to output the
  number of files associated with matching messages. This may be
  bigger than the number of matching messages due to duplicates
  (i.e. multiple files having the same message-id).

Improved `notmuch new` performance for unchanged folders

  `notmuch new` now skips over unchanged folders more efficiently,
  which can substantially improve the performance of checking for new
  mail in some situations (like NFS-mounted Maildirs).

`notmuch reply --format=text` RFC 2047-encodes headers

  Previously, this used a mix of standard MIME encoding for the reply
  body and UTF-8 for the headers.  Now, the text format reply template
  RFC 2047-encodes the headers, making the output a valid RFC 2822
  message.  The JSON/sexp format is unchanged.

`notmuch compact` command

  The new `compact` command exposes Xapian's compaction
  functionality through a more convenient interface than
  `xapian-compact`. `notmuch compact` will compact the database to a
  temporary location, optionally backup the original database, and
  move the compacted database into place.

Emacs Interface
---------------

`notmuch-tree` (formerly `notmuch-pick`) has been added to mainline

  `notmuch-tree` is a threaded message view for the emacs
  interface. Each message is one line in the results and the thread
  structure is shown using UTF-8 box drawing characters (similar to
  Mutt's threaded view). It comes between search and show in terms of
  amount of output and can be useful for viewing both single threads
  and multiple threads.

  Using `notmuch-tree`

  The main key entries to notmuch tree are

  'z' enter a query to view using notmuch tree (works in hello,
      search, show and tree mode itself)

  'Z' view the current query in tree notmuch tree (works from search
      and show)

  Once in tree mode, keybindings are mostly in line with the rest of
  notmuch and are all viewable with '?' as usual.

  Customising `notmuch-tree`

  `notmuch-tree` has several customisation variables. The most
  significant is the first notmuch-tree-show-out which determines the
  behaviour when selecting a message (with RET) in tree view. By
  default tree view uses a split window showing the single message in
  the bottom pane. However, if this option is set then it views the
  whole thread in the complete window jumping to the selected message
  in the thread. In either case command-prefix selects the other option.

Tagging threads in search is now race-free

  Previously, adding or removing a tag from a thread in a search
  buffer would affect messages that had arrived after the search was
  performed, resulting in, for example, archiving messages that were
  never seen.  Tagging now affects only the messages that were in the
  thread when the search was performed.

`notmuch-hello` refreshes when switching to the buffer

  The hello buffer now refreshes whenever you switch to the buffer,
  regardless of how you get there.  You can disable automatic
  refreshing by customizing `notmuch-hello-auto-refresh`.

Specific mini-buffer prompts for tagging operations

  When entering tags to add or remove, the mini-buffer prompt now
  indicates what operation will be performed (e.g., "Tag thread", "Tag
  message", etc).

Built-in help improvements

  Documentation for many commands has been improved, as displayed by
  `notmuch-help` (usually bound to "?").  The bindings listed by
  `notmuch-help` also now include descriptions of prefixed commands.

Quote replies as they are displayed in show view

  We now render the parts for reply quoting the same way they are
  rendered for show. At this time, the notable change is that replies
  to text/calendar are now pretty instead of raw vcalendar.

Fixed inconsistent use of configured search order

  All ways of interactively invoking search now honor the value of
  `notmuch-search-oldest-first`.

Common keymap for notmuch-wide bindings

  Several key bindings have been moved from mode-specific keymaps to
  the single `notmuch-common-keymap`, which is inherited by each
  notmuch mode.  If you've customized your key bindings, you may want
  to move some of them to the common keymap.

The `notmuch-tag` function now requires a list of tag changes

  For users who have scripted the Emacs interface: the `notmuch-tag`
  API has changed.  Previously, it accepted either a list of tag
  changes or a space-separated string of tag changes.  The latter is
  no longer supported and the function now returns nothing.

Fixed `notmuch-reply` putting reply in primary selection

  On emacs 24 notmuch-reply used to put the cited text into the
  primary selection (which could lead to inadvertently pasting this
  cited text elsewhere). Now the primary-selection is not changed.

Fixed `notmuch-show` invisible part handling

  In some obscure cases part buttons and invisibility had strange
  interactions: in particular, the default action for some parts gave
  the wrong action. This has been fixed.

Fixed `notmuch-show` attachment viewers and stderr

  In emacs 24.3+ viewing an attachment could cause spurious text to
  appear in the show buffer (any stderr or stdout the viewer
  produced). By default this output is now discarded. For debugging,
  setting `notmuch-show-attachment-debug` causes notmuch to keep the
  viewer's stderr and stdout in a separate buffer.

Fixed `notmuch-mua-reply` point placement when signature involved

  By restricting cursor movement to body section for cursor placement
  after signature is inserted, the cursor cannot "leak" to header
  section anymore. Now inserted citation content will definitely go to
  the body part of the message.

Vim Interface
-------------

  It is now possible to compose new messages in the Vim interface, as
  opposed reply to existing messages.  There is also support for
  going straight to a search (bypassing the folders view).

Notmuch 0.16 (2013-08-03)
=========================

Command-Line Interface
----------------------

Support for delivering messages to Maildir

  There is a new command `insert` that adds a message to a Maildir
  folder and notmuch index.

`notmuch count --batch` option

  `notmuch count` now supports batch operations similar to `notmuch
  tag`. This is mostly an optimization for remote notmuch usage.

`notmuch tag` option to remove all tags from matching messages

  `notmuch tag --remove-all` option has been added to remove all tags
  from matching messages. This can be combined with adding new tags,
  resulting in setting (rather than modifying) the tags of the
  messages.

Decrypting commands explicitly expect a gpg-agent

  Decryption in `notmuch show` and `notmuch reply` has only ever
  worked with a functioning gpg-agent. This is now made explicit in
  code and documentation. The functional change is that it's now
  possible to have gpg-agent running, but gpg "use-agent"
  configuration option disabled, not forcing the user to use the agent
  everywhere.

Configuration file saves follow symbolic links

  The notmuch commands that save the configuration file now follow
  symbolic links instead of overwrite them.

Top level option to specify configuration file

  It's now possible to specify the configuration file to use on the
  command line using the `notmuch --config=FILE` option.

Bash command-line completion

  The notmuch command-line completion support for the bash shell has
  been rewritten. Supported completions include all the notmuch
  commands, command-line arguments, values for keyword arguments,
  search prefixes (such as "subject:" or "from:") in all commands that
  use search terms, tags after + and - in `notmuch tag`, tags after
  "tag:" prefix, user's email addresses after "from:" and "to:"
  prefixes, and config options (and some config option values) in
  `notmuch config`. The new completion support depends on the
  bash-completion package.

Deprecated commands "part" and "search-tags" are removed.

Emacs Interface
---------------

New keymap to view/save parts; removed s/v/o/| part button bindings

  The commands to view, save, and open MIME parts are now prefixed
  with "." (". s" to save, ". v" to view, etc) and can be invoked with
  point anywhere in a part, unlike the old commands, which were
  restricted to part buttons.  The old "s"/"v"/"o"/"|" commands on
  part buttons have been removed since they clashed with other
  bindings (notably "s" for search!) and could not be invoked when
  there was no part button.  The new, prefixed bindings appear in
  show's help, so you no longer have to memorize them.

Default part save directory is now `mm-default-directory`

  Previously, notmuch offered to save parts and attachments to a mix
  of `mm-default-directory`, `mailcap-download-directory`, and `~/`.
  This has been standardized on `mm-default-directory`.

Key bindings for next/previous thread

  Show view has new key bindings M-n and M-p to move to the next and
  previous thread in the search results.

Better handling of errors in search buffers

  Instead of interleaving errors in search result buffers, search mode
  now reports errors in the minibuffer.

Faster search and show

  Communication between Emacs and the notmuch CLI is now more
  efficient because it uses the CLI's S-expression support.  As a
  result, search mode should now fill search buffers faster and
  threads should show faster.

No Emacs 22 support

  The Emacs 22 support added late 2010 was sufficient only for a short
  period of time. After being incomplete for roughly 2 years the code
  in question was now removed from this release.

Vim Front-End
-------------

The vim based front-end has been replaced with a new one that uses the Ruby
bindings. The old font-end is available in the contrib subfolder.

Python Bindings
---------------

Fix loading of libnotmuch shared library on OS X (Darwin) systems.

Notmuch 0.15.2 (2013-02-17)
===========================

Build fixes
-----------

Update dependencies to avoid problems when building in parallel.

Internal test framework changes
-------------------------------

Adjust Emacs test watchdog mechanism to cope with `process-attributes`
being unimplemented.

Notmuch 0.15.1 (2013-01-24)
===========================

Internal test framework changes
-------------------------------

Set a default value for TERM when running tests. This fixes certain
build failures in non-interactive environments.

Notmuch 0.15 (2013-01-18)
=========================

General
-------

Date range search support

  The `date:` prefix can now be used in queries to restrict the results
  to only messages within a particular time range (based on the Date:
  header) with a range syntax of `date:<since>..<until>`. Notmuch
  supports a wide variety of expressions in `<since>` and
  `<until>`. Please refer to the `notmuch-search-terms(7)` manual page
  for details.

Empty tag names and tags beginning with "-" are deprecated

  Such tags have been a frequent source of confusion and cause
  (sometimes unresolvable) conflicts with other syntax.  notmuch tag
  no longer allows such tags to be added to messages.  Removing such
  tags continues to be supported to allow cleanup of existing tags,
  but may be removed in a future release.

Command-Line Interface
----------------------

`notmuch new` no longer chokes on mboxes

  `notmuch new` now rejects mbox files containing more than one
  message, rather than treating the file as one giant message.

Support for single message mboxes is deprecated

  For historical reasons, `notmuch new` will index mbox files
  containing a single message; however, this behavior is now
  officially deprecated.

Fixed `notmuch new` to skip ignored broken symlinks

  `notmuch new` now correctly skips symlinks if they are in the
  ignored files list.  Previously, it would abort when encountering
  broken symlink, even if it was ignored.

New dump/restore format and tagging interface

  There is a new `batch-tag` format for dump and restore that is more
  robust, particularly with respect to tags and message-ids containing
  whitespace.

  `notmuch tag` now supports the ability to read tag operations and
  queries from an input stream, in a format compatible with the new
  dump/restore format.

Bcc and Reply-To headers are now available in notmuch show json output

  The `notmuch show --format=json` now includes "Bcc" and "Reply-To" headers.
  For example notmuch Emacs client can now have these headers visible
  when the headers are added to the `notmuch-message-headers` variable.

CLI callers can now request a specific output format version

  `notmuch` subcommands that support structured output now support a
  `--format-version` argument for requesting a specific version of the
  structured output, enabling better compatibility and error handling.

`notmuch search` has gained a null character separated text output format

  The new --format=text0 output format for `notmuch search` prints
  output separated by null characters rather than newline
  characters. This is similar to the find(1) -print0 option, and works
  together with the xargs(1) -0 option.

Emacs Interface
---------------

Removal of the deprecated `notmuch-folders` variable

  `notmuch-folders` has been deprecated since the introduction of saved
  searches and the notmuch hello view in notmuch 0.3. `notmuch-folders`
  has now been removed. Any remaining users should migrate to
  `notmuch-saved-searches`.

Visibility of MIME parts can be toggled

  Each part of a multi-part MIME email can now be shown or hidden
  using the button at the top of each part (by pressing RET on it or
  by clicking).  For emails with multiple alternative formats (e.g.,
  plain text and HTML), only the preferred format is shown initially,
  but other formats can be shown using their part buttons.  To control
  the behavior of this, see
  `notmuch-multipart/alternative-discouraged` and
  `notmuch-show-all-multipart/alternative-parts`.

  Note notmuch-show-print-message (bound to '#' by default) will print
  all parts of multipart/alternative message regardless of whether
  they are currently hidden or shown in the buffer.

Emacs now buttonizes mid: links

  mid: links are a standardized way to link to messages by message ID
  (see RFC 2392).  Emacs now hyperlinks mid: links to the appropriate
  notmuch search.

Handle errors from bodypart insertions

  If displaying the text of a message in show mode causes an error (in
  the `notmuch-show-insert-part-*` functions), notmuch no longer cuts
  off thread display at the offending message.  The error is now
  simply displayed in place of the message.

Emacs now detects version mismatches with the notmuch CLI

  Emacs now detects and reports when the Emacs interface version and
  the notmuch CLI version are incompatible.

Improved text/calendar content handling

  Carriage returns in embedded text/calendar content caused insertion
  of the calendar content fail. Now CRs are removed before calling icalendar
  to extract icalendar data. In case icalendar extraction fails an error
  is thrown for the bodypart insertion function to deal with.

Disabled coding conversions when reading in `with-current-notmuch-show-message`

  Depending on the user's locale, saving attachments containing 8-bit
  data may have performed an unintentional encoding conversion,
  corrupting the saved attachment.  This has been fixed by making
  `with-current-notmuch-show-message` disable coding conversion.

Fixed errors with HTML email containing images in Emacs 24

  Emacs 24 ships with a new HTML renderer that produces better output,
  but is slightly buggy.  We work around a bug that caused it to fail
  for HTML email containing images.

Fixed handling of tags with unusual characters in them

  Emacs now handles tags containing spaces, quotes, and parenthesis.

Fixed buttonization of id: links without quote characters

  Emacs now correctly buttonizes id: links where the message ID is not
  quoted.

`notmuch-hello` refresh point placement improvements

  Refreshing the `notmuch-hello` buffer does a better job of keeping
  the point where it was.

Automatic tag changes are now unified and customizable

  All the automatic tag changes that the Emacs interface makes when
  reading, archiving, or replying to messages, can now be
  customized. Any number of tag additions and removals is supported
  through the `notmuch-show-mark-read`, `notmuch-archive-tags`, and
  `notmuch-message-replied-tags` customization variables.

Support for stashing the thread id in show view

  Invoking `notmuch-show-stash-message-id` with a prefix argument
  stashes the (local and database specific) thread id of the current
  thread instead of the message id.

New add-on tool: notmuch-pick
-----------------------------

The new contrib/ tool `notmuch-pick` is an experimental threaded message
view for the emacs interface. Each message is one line in the results
and the thread structure is shown using UTF-8 box drawing characters
(similar to Mutt's threaded view). It comes between search and show in
terms of amount of output and can be useful for viewing both single
threads and multiple threads. See the notmuch-pick README file for
further details and installation.

Portability
-----------

notmuch now builds on OpenBSD.

Internal test framework changes
-------------------------------

The emacsclient binary is now user-configurable

  The test framework now accepts `TEST_EMACSCLIENT` in addition to
  `TEST_EMACS` for configuring the emacsclient to use.  This is
  necessary to avoid using an old emacsclient with a new emacs, which
  can result in buggy behavior.

Notmuch 0.14 (2012-08-20)
=========================

General bug fixes
-----------------

Maildir tag synchronization

  Maildir flag-to-tag synchronization now applies only to messages in
  maildir-like directory structures.  Previously, it applied to any
  message that had a maildir "info" part, which meant it could
  incorrectly synchronize tags for non-maildir messages, while at the
  same time failing to synchronize tags for newly received maildir
  messages (typically causing new messages to not receive the "unread"
  tag).

Command-Line Interface
----------------------

  The deprecated positional output file argument to `notmuch dump` has
  been replaced with an `--output` option. The input file positional
  argument to `notmuch restore` has been replaced with an `--input`
  option for consistency with dump.  These changes simplify the syntax
  of dump/restore options and make them more consistent with other
  notmuch commands.

Emacs Interface
---------------

Search results now get re-colored when tags are updated

The formatting of tags in search results can now be customized

  Previously, attempting to change the format of tags in
  `notmuch-search-result-format` would usually break tagging from
  search-mode.  We no longer make assumptions about the format.

Experimental support for multi-line search result formats

  It is now possible to embed newlines in
  `notmuch-search-result-format` to make individual search results
  span multiple lines.

Next/previous in search and show now move by boundaries

  All "next" and "previous" commands in the search and show modes now
  move to the next/previous result or message boundary.  This doesn't
  change the behavior of "next", but "previous" commands will first
  move to the beginning of the current result or message if point is
  inside the result or message.

Search now uses the JSON format internally

  This should address problems with unusual characters in authors and
  subject lines that could confuse the old text-based search parser.

The date shown in search results is no longer padded before applying
user-specified formatting

  Previously, the date in the search results was padded to fixed width
  before being formatted with `notmuch-search-result-format`.  It is
  no longer padded.  The default format has been updated, but if
  you've customized this variable, you may have to change your date
  format from `"%s "` to `"%12s "`.

The thread-id for the `target-thread` argument for `notmuch-search` should
now be supplied without the "thread:" prefix.

Notmuch 0.13.2 (2012-06-02)
===========================

Bug-fix release
---------------

Update `contrib/notmuch-deliver` for API changes in 0.13. This fixes a
compilation error for this contrib package.

Notmuch 0.13.1 (2012-05-29)
===========================

Bug-fix release
---------------

Fix inserting of UTF-8 characters from *text/plain* parts in reply

  While notmuch gained ability to insert content from other than *text/plain*
  parts of email whenever *text/plain* parts are not available (notably
  HTML-only emails), replying to mails that do have *text/plain* the
  non-ASCII characters were incorrectly decoded. This is now fixed.

`notmuch_database_get_directory` and
`notmuch_database_find_message_by_filename` now work on read-only
databases

  Previously, these functions attempted to create directory documents
  that didn't exist and would return an error or abort when given a
  read-only database.  Now they no longer create directory documents
  and simply return a `NULL` object if the directory does not exist,
  as documented.

Fix compilation of ruby bindings

  Revert to dynamic linking, since the statically linked bindings did
  not work well.

Notmuch 0.13 (2012-05-15)
=========================

Command-Line Interface
----------------------

JSON reply format

  `notmuch reply` can now produce JSON output that contains the headers
  for a reply message and full information about the original message
  begin replied to. This allows MUAs to create replies intelligently.
  For example, an MUA that can parse HTML might quote HTML parts.

  Calling notmuch reply with `--format=json` imposes the restriction that
  only a single message is returned by the search, as replying to
  multiple messages does not have a well-defined behavior. The default
  retains its current behavior for multiple message replies.

Tag exclusion

  Tags can be automatically excluded from search results by adding them
  to the new `search.exclude_tags` option in the Notmuch config file.

  This behaviour can be overridden by explicitly including an excluded
  tag in your query, for example:

        notmuch search $your_query and tag:$excluded_tag

  Existing users will probably want to run `notmuch setup` again to add
  the new well-commented [search] section to the configuration file.

  For new configurations, accepting the default setting will cause the
  tags "deleted" and "spam" to be excluded, equivalent to running:

        notmuch config set search.exclude_tags deleted spam

Raw show format changes

  The output of show `--format=raw` has changed for multipart and
  message parts.  Previously, the output was a mash of somewhat-parsed
  headers and transfer-decoded bodies.  Now, such parts are reproduced
  faithfully from the original source.  Message parts (which includes
  part 0) output the full message, including the message headers (but
  not the transfer headers).  Multipart parts output the part as
  encoded in the original message, including the part's headers.  Leaf
  parts, as before, output the part's transfer-decoded body.

Listing configuration items

  The new `config list` command prints out all configuration items and
  their values.

Emacs Interface
---------------

Changes to tagging interface

  The user-facing tagging functions in the Emacs interface have been
  normalized across all notmuch modes.  The tagging functions are now
  notmuch-search-tag in search-mode, and notmuch-show-tag in
  show-mode.  They accept a string representing a single tag change,
  or a list of tag changes.  See 'M-x describe-function notmuch-tag'
  for more information.

  NOTE: This breaks compatibility with old tagging functions, so user
  may need to update in custom configurations.

Reply improvement using the JSON format

  Emacs now uses the JSON reply format to create replies. It obeys
  the customization variables message-citation-line-format and
  message-citation-line-function when creating the first line of the
  reply body, and it will quote HTML parts if no text/plain parts are
  available.

New add-on tool: notmuch-mutt
-----------------------------

The new contrib/ tool `notmuch-mutt` provides Notmuch integration for
the Mutt mail user agent. Using it, Mutt users can perform mail
search, thread reconstruction, and mail tagging/untagging without
leaving Mutt.  notmuch-mutt, formerly distributed under the name
`mutt-notmuch` by Stefano Zacchiroli, will be maintained as a notmuch
contrib/ from now on.

Library changes
---------------

The API changes detailed below break binary and source compatibility,
so libnotmuch has been bumped to version 3.0.0.

The function `notmuch_database_close` has been split into
`notmuch_database_close` and `notmuch_database_destroy`

  This makes it possible for long running programs to close the xapian
  database and thus release the lock associated with it without
  destroying the data structures obtained from it.

`notmuch_database_open`, `notmuch_database_create`, and
`notmuch_database_get_directory` now return errors

  The type signatures of these functions have changed so that the
  functions now return a `notmuch_status_t` and take an out-argument for
  returning the new database object or directory object.

Go bindings changes
-------------------

Go 1 compatibility

  The go bindings and the `notmuch-addrlookup` utility are now
  compatible with go 1.

Notmuch 0.12 (2012-03-20)
=========================

Command-Line Interface
----------------------

Reply to sender

  `notmuch reply` has gained the ability to create a reply template
  for replying just to the sender of the message, in addition to reply
  to all. The feature is available through the new command line option
  `--reply-to=(all|sender)`.

Mail store folder/file ignore

  A new configuration option, `new.ignore`, lets users specify a
  ;-separated list of file and directory names that will not be
  searched for messages by `notmuch new`.

  NOTE: *Every* file/directory that goes by one of those names will
  be ignored, independent of its depth/location in the mail store.

Unified help and manual pages

  The notmuch help command now runs man for the appropriate page.  If
  you install notmuch somewhere "unusual", you may need to update
  MANPATH.

Manual page for notmuch configuration options

  The notmuch CLI configuration file options are now documented in the
  notmuch-config(1) manual page in addition to the configuration file
  itself.

Emacs Interface
---------------

Reply to sender

  The Emacs interface has, with the new CLI support, gained the
  ability to reply to sender in addition to reply to all. In both show
  and search modes, 'r' has been bound to reply to sender, replacing
  reply to all, which now has key binding 'R'.

More flexible and consistent tagging operations

  All tagging operations ('+', '-', '*') now accept multiple tags with
  '+' or '-' prefix, like '*' operation in notmuch-search view before.

  '*' operation (`notmuch-show-tag-all`) is now available in
  notmuch-show view.

  `notmuch-show-{add,remove}-tag` functions no longer accept tag
  argument, `notmuch-show-tag-message` should be used instead.  Custom
  bindings using these functions should be updated, e.g.:

        (notmuch-show-remove-tag "unread")

  should be changed to:

        (notmuch-show-tag-message "-unread")

Refreshing the show view ('=' by default) no longer opens or closes messages

  To get the old behavior of putting messages back in their initial
  opened/closed state, use a prefix argument, e.g., 'C-u ='.

Attachment buttons can be used to view or save attachments.

  When the cursor is on an attachment button the key 's' can be used
  to save the attachment, the key 'v' to view the attachment in the
  default mailcap application, and the key 'o' prompts the user for an
  application to use to open the attachment. By default Enter or mouse
  button 1 saves the attachment but this is customisable (option
  Notmuch Show Part Button Default Action).

New functions

  `notmuch-show-stash-mlarchive-link{,-and-go}` allow stashing and
  optionally visiting a URI to the current message at one of a number
  of Mailing List Archives.

Fix MML tag quoting in replies

  The MML tag quoting fix of 0.11.1 unintentionally quoted tags
  inserted in `message-setup-hook`. Quoting is now limited to the
  cited message.

Show view archiving key binding changes

  The show view archiving key bindings 'a' and 'x' now remove the
  "inbox" tag from the current message only (instead of thread), and
  move to the next message. At the last message, 'a' proceeds to the
  next thread in search results, and 'x' returns to search
  results. The thread archiving functions are now available in 'A' and
  'X'.

Support text/calendar MIME type

  The text/calendar MIME type is now supported in addition to
  text/x-vcalendar.

Generate inline patch fake attachment file names from message subject

  Use the message subject to generate file names for the inline patch
  fake attachments. The names are now similar to the ones generated by
  'git format-patch' instead of just "inline patch". See "Notmuch Show
  Insert Text/Plain Hook" in the notmuch customize interface.

Enable `notmuch-search-line-faces` by default

  Make the `notmuch-search-line-faces` functionality more discoverable
  for new users by showing "unread" messages bold and "flagged"
  messages blue by default in the search view.

Printing Support

  notmuch-show mode now has simple printing support, bound to '#' by
  default. You can customize the variable notmuch-print-mechanism.

Library changes
---------------

New functions

  `notmuch_query_add_tag_exclude` supports the new tag exclusion
  feature.

Python bindings changes
-----------------------

Python 3.2 compatibility

  The python bindings are now compatible with both python 2.5+ and 3.2.

Added missing unicode conversions

  Python strings have to be encoded to and decoded from utf-8 when
  calling libnotmuch functions. Porting the bindings to python 3.2
  revealed a few function calls that were missing these conversions.

Build fixes
-----------

Compatibility with GMime 2.6

  It is now possible to build notmuch against both GMime 2.4 and 2.6.
  However, a bug in GMime 2.6 before 2.6.5 causes notmuch not to
  report signatures where the signer key is unavailable (GNOME bug
  668085).  For compatibility with GMime 2.4's tolerance of "From "
  headers we require GMime 2.6 >= 2.6.7.

Notmuch 0.11.1 (2012-02-03)
===========================

Bug-fix release
---------------

Fix error handling in python bindings

  The python bindings in 0.11 failed to detect NULL pointers being
  returned from libnotmuch functions and thus failed to raise
  exceptions to indicate the error condition. Any subsequent calls
  into libnotmuch caused segmentation faults.

Quote MML tags in replies

  MML tags are text codes that Emacs uses to indicate attachments
  (among other things) in messages being composed.  The Emacs
  interface did not quote MML tags in the quoted text of a reply.
  User could be tricked into replying to a maliciously formatted
  message and not editing out the MML tags from the quoted text.  This
  could lead to files from the user's machine being attached to the
  outgoing message.  The Emacs interface now quotes these tags in
  reply text, so that they do not effect outgoing messages.

Notmuch 0.11 (2012-01-13)
=========================

Command-Line Interface
----------------------

Hooks

  Hooks have been introduced to notmuch. Hooks are scripts that notmuch
  invokes before and after certain actions. Initially, `notmuch new`
  supports `pre-new` and `post-new` hooks that are run before and after
  importing new messages into the database.

`notmuch reply --decrypt bugfix`

  The `notmuch reply` command with `--decrypt` argument had a rarely
  occurring bug that caused an encrypted message not to be decrypted
  sometimes. This is now fixed.

Performance
-----------

Automatic tag query optimization

  `notmuch tag` now automatically optimizes the user's query to
  exclude messages whose tags won't change.  In the past, we've
  suggested that people do this by hand; this is no longer necessary.

Don't sort messages when creating a dump file

  This speeds up tag dumps considerably, without any loss of
  information. To replicate the old behavior of sorted output (for
  example to compare two dump files), one can use e.g. `sort(1)`.

Memory Management
-----------------

Reduction of memory leaks

  Two memory leaks when searching and showing messages were identified
  and fixed in this release.

Emacs Interface
---------------

Bug fixes

  notmuch-show-advance (bound to the spacebar in notmuch-show-mode) had
  a bug that caused it to always jump to the next message, even if it
  should have scrolled down to show more of the current message instead.
  This is now fixed.

Support `notmuch new` as a notmuch-poll-script

  It's now possible to use `notmuch new` as a notmuch-poll-script
  directly. This is also the new default. This allows taking better
  advantage of the `notmuch new` hooks from emacs without intermediate
  scripts.

Improvements in saved search management

  New saved searches are now appended to the list of saved searches,
  not inserted in front. It's also possible to define a sort function
  for displaying saved searches; alphabetical sort is provided.

Hooks for notmuch-hello

  Two new hooks have been added: "notmuch-hello-mode-hook" (called after
  entering notmuch-hello-mode) and "notmuch-hello-refresh-hook" (called
  after updating a notmuch-hello buffer).

New face for crypto parts headers

  Crypto parts used to be displayed with a hardcoded color. A new face
  has been introduced to fix this: notmuch-crypto-part-header. It
  defaults to the same value as before, but can be customized to match
  other color themes.

Use space as default thousands separator

  Large numbers in notmuch-hello are now displayed using a space as
  thousands separator (e.g. "123 456" instead of "123,456"). This can be
  changed by customizing "notmuch-hello-thousands-separator".

Call notmuch-show instead of notmuch-search when clicking on
buttonized id: links

New function notmuch-show-advance

  This new function advances through just the current thread, and is
  less invasive than notmuch-show-advance-and-archive.  It can easily
  be bound to SPC with:

        (define-key notmuch-show-mode-map " " 'notmuch-show-advance)

Various performance improvements

New add-on tool
---------------

The tool `contrib/notmuch-deliver` helps with initial delivery and
tagging of mail (replacing running `notmuch new`).


Notmuch 0.10.2 (2011-12-04)
===========================

Bug-fix release
---------------

Fix crash in python bindings

  The python bindings did not call `g_type_init`, which caused crashes
  for some, but not all users.

Notmuch 0.10.1 (2011-11-25)
===========================

Bug-fix release
---------------

Fix `--help` argument

  Argument processing changes in 0.10 introduced a bug where
  `notmuch --help` crashed while `notmuch help` worked fine.
  This is fixed in 0.10.1.

Notmuch 0.10 (2011-11-23)
=========================

New build and testing features
------------------------------

Emacs tests are now done in `dtach`. This means that dtach is now
needed to run the notmuch test suite, at least until the checking for
prerequisites is improved.

Full test coverage of the stashing feature in Emacs.

New command-line features
-------------------------

Add `notmuch restore --accumulate` option

  The `--accumulate` switch causes the union of the existing and new tags to
  be applied, instead of replacing each message's tags as they are read in
  from the dump file.

Add search terms to `notmuch dump`

  The dump command now takes an optional search term much like notmuch
  search/show/tag. The output file argument of dump is deprecated in
  favour of using stdout.

Add `notmuch search` `--offset` and `--limit` options

  The search command now takes options `--offset=[-]N` and `--limit=N` to
  limit the number of results shown.

Add `notmuch count --output` option

  The count command is now capable of counting threads in addition to
  messages. This is selected using the new `--output=(threads|messages)`
  option.

New emacs UI features
---------------------

Add tab-completion for `notmuch-search` and `notmuch-search-filter`

  These functions now support completion tags for query parts
  starting with "tag:".

Turn "id:MSG-ID" links into buttons associated with notmuch searches

  Text of the form "id:MSG-ID" in mails is now a clickable button that
  opens a notmuch search for the given message id.

Add keybinding ('c I') for stashing Message-ID's without an id: prefix

  Reduces manual labor when stashing them for use outside notmuch.

Do not query on `notmuch-search` exit

  It is harmless to kill the external notmuch process, so the user
  is no longer interrogated when they interrupt a search.

Performance
-----------

Emacs now constructs large search buffers more efficiently

Search avoids opening and parsing message files

  We now store more information in the database so search no longer
  has to open every message file to get basic headers.  This can
  improve search speed by as much as 10X, but taking advantage of this
  requires a database rebuild:

        notmuch dump > notmuch.dump
        # Backup, then remove notmuch database ($MAIL/.notmuch)
        notmuch new
        notmuch restore notmuch.dump

New collection of add-on tools
------------------------------

The source directory "contrib" contains tools built on notmuch.  These
tools are not part of notmuch, and you should check their individual
licenses.  Feel free to report problems with them to the notmuch
mailing list.

nmbug - share tags with a given prefix

  nmbug helps maintain a git repo containing all tags with a given
  prefix (by default "notmuch::"). Tags can be shared by committing
  them to git in one location and restoring in another.

Notmuch 0.9 (2011-10-01)
========================

New, general features
---------------------

Correct handling of interruptions during `notmuch new`

  `notmuch new` now operates as a series of small, self-consistent
  transactions, so it can correctly resume after an interruption or
  crash.  Previously, interruption could lose existing tags, fail to
  detect messages on resume, or leave the database in a state
  temporarily or permanently inconsistent with the mail store.

Library changes
---------------

New functions

  `notmuch_database_begin_atomic` and `notmuch_database_end_atomic`
  allow multiple database operations to be performed atomically.

  `notmuch_database_find_message_by_filename` does exactly what it says.

API changes

  `notmuch_database_find_message` (and `n_d_f_m_by_filename`) now return
  a status indicator and uses an output parameter for the
  message. This change required changing the SONAME of libnotmuch to
  libnotmuch.so.2

Python bindings changes
-----------------------

  - Re-encode python unicode objects to utf-8 before passing back to
    libnotmuch.
  - Support `Database().begin_atomic()/end_atomic()`
  - Support `Database().find_message_by_filename()`
    NB! This needs a db opened in READ-WRITE mode currently, or it will crash
    the python process. The is a limitation (=bug) of the underlying libnotmuch.
  - Fixes where we would not throw NotmuchErrors when we should (Justus Winter)
  - Update for `n_d_find_message*` API changes (see above).

Ruby bindings changes
---------------------

  - Wrap new library functions `notmuch_database_{begin,end}_atomic.`
  - Add new exception `Notmuch::UnbalancedAtomicError.`
  - Rename destroy to destroy! according to Ruby naming conventions.
  - Update for `n_d_find_message*` API changes (see above).

Emacs improvements
------------------

  * Add gpg callback to crypto sigstatus buttons to retrieve/refresh
    signing key.
  * Add `notmuch-show-refresh-view` function (and corresponding binding)
    to refresh the view of a notmuch-show buffer.

Reply formatting cleanup
------------------------

  `notmuch reply` no longer includes notification that non-leafnode
  MIME parts are being suppressed.

Notmuch 0.8 (2011-09-10)
========================

Improved handling of message/rfc822 parts

  Both in the CLI and the emacs interface.  Output of rfc822 parts now
  includes the primary headers, as well as the body and all subparts.
  Output of the completely raw rfc822-formatted message, including all
  headers, is unfortunately not yet supported (but hopefully will be
  soon).

Improved Build system portability

  Certain parts of the shell script generating notmuch.sym were
  specific to the GNU versions of sed and nm. The new version should
  be more portable to e.g. OpenBSD.

Documentation update for Ruby bindings

  Added documentation, typo fixes, and improved support for rdoc.

Unicode, iterator, PEP8 changes for python bindings

  - PEP8 (code formatting) changes for python files.
  - Remove `Tags.__len__` ; see 0.6 release notes for motivation.
  - Decode headers as UTF8, encode (unicode) database paths as UTF8.

Notmuch 0.7 (2011-08-01)
========================

Vim interface improvements
--------------------------

Jason Woofenden provided a number of bug fixes for the Vim interface

  * fix citation/signature fold lengths
  * fix cig/cit parsing within multipart/*
  * fix on-screen instructions for show-signature
  * fix from list reformatting in search view
  * fix space key: now archives (did opposite)

Uwe Kleine-König contributed

  * use full path for sendmail/doc fix
  * fix compose temp file name

Python Bindings changes
-----------------------

Sebastian Spaeth contributed two changes related to unicode and UTF8:

  * message tags are now explicitly unicode
  * query string is encoded as a UTF8 byte string

Build-System improvements
-------------------------

Generate notmuch.sym after the relevant object files

  This fixes a bug in parallel building. Thanks to Thomas Jost for the
  patch.

Notmuch 0.6.1 (2011-07-17)
==========================

Bug-fix release
---------------

Re-export Xapian exception typeinfo symbols

  It turned out our aggressive symbol hiding caused problems for
  people running gcc 4.4.5.

Notmuch 0.6 (2011-07-01)
=======================

New, general features
---------------------

Folder-based searching

  Notmuch queries can now include a search term to match the
  directories in which mail files are stored (within the mail
  storage). The syntax is as follows:

        folder:<path>

  For example, one might use things such as:

        folder:spam
        folder:2011-*
        folder:work/todo

  to match any path containing a directory "spam", "work/todo", or
  containing a directory starting with "2011-", respectively.

  This feature is particularly useful for users of delivery-agent
  software (such as procmail or maildrop) that is filtering mail and
  delivering it to particular folders, or users of systems such as
  Gmail that use filesystem directories to indicate message tags.

  NOTE: Only messages that are newly indexed with this version of
  notmuch will be searchable with folder: terms. In order to enable
  this feature for all mail, the entire notmuch index will need to be
  rebuilt as follows:

        notmuch dump > notmuch.dump
        # Backup, then remove notmuch database ($MAIL/.notmuch)
        notmuch new
        notmuch restore notmuch.dump

Support for PGP/MIME

  Both the command-line interface and the emacs-interface have new
  support for PGP/MIME, detailed below. Thanks to Daniel Kahn Gillmor
  and Jameson Graef Rollins for making this happen.

New, automatic tags: "signed" and "encrypted"

  These tags will automatically be applied to messages containing
  multipart/signed and multipart/encrypted parts.

  NOTE: Only messages that are newly indexed with this version of
  notmuch will receive these tags.

New command-line features
-------------------------

Add new "notmuch show --verify" option for signature verification

  This option instruct notmuch to verify the signature of
  PGP/MIME-signed parts.

Add new "notmuch show --decrypt" and "notmuch reply --decrypt" options

  This option instructs notmuch to decrypt PGP/MIME-encrypted parts.
  Note that this feature currently requires gpg-agent and a passphrase entry
  tool (e.g. pinentry-gtk or pinentry-curses).

Proper nesting of multipart parts in "notmuch show" output

  MIME parts are now display with proper nesting to reflect original
  MIME hierarchy of a message. This allows clients to correctly
  analyze the MIME structure, (such as, for example, determining to
  which parts a signature part applies).

Add new "notmuch show --part" option

  This is a replacement for the older "notmuch part" command, (which
  is now deprecated—it should still work as always, but is no longer
  documented). Putting part output under "notmuch show" allows for all
  of the "notmuch show" options to be applied when extracting a single
  part, (such as --format=json for extracting a message part with JSON
  formatting).

Deprecate "notmuch search-tags" (in favor of "notmuch search --output=tags *")

  The "notmuch search-tags" sub-command has been redundant since the
  addition of the --output=tags option to "notmuch search". We now
  make that more clear by deprecating "notmuch search-tags", (dropping
  it from the documentation). We do continue to support the old syntax
  by translating it internally to the new call.

Performance improvements
------------------------

Faster searches (by doing fewer searches to construct threads)

  Whenever a user asks for search results as threads, notmuch first
  performs a search for messages matching the query, then performs
  additional searches to find other messages in the resulting threads.

  Removing inefficiencies and redundancies in these secondary searches
  results in a measured speedups of 1.5x for a typical search.

Faster searches (by doing fewer passes to gather message data)

  Optimizing Xapian data access patterns (using a single pass to get
  all message-document data rather than a pass for each data type)
  results in a measured speedup of 1.7x for a typical search.

  The benefits of this optimization combine with the preceding
  optimization. With both in place, Austin Clements measured a speedup
  of 2.5x for a search of all messages in his inbox (was 4.5s, now
  1.8s). Thanks, Austin!

Faster initial indexing

  More efficient indexing of new messages results in a measured
  speedup of 1.4x for the initial indexing of 3 GB of mail (1h 14m
  rather than 1h 46m). Thanks to Austin Clements and Michal Sojka.

Make "notmuch new" faster for unchanged directories

  Optimizing to not do any further examinations of sub-directories
  when the filesystem indicates that a directory is unchanged from the
  last "notmuch new" results in measured speedups of 8.5 for the "No
  new mail" case, (was 0.77s, now 0.09s). Thanks to Karel Zak.

New emacs-interface features
----------------------------

Support for PGP/MIME (GnuPG)

  Automatically indicate validity of signatures for multipart/signed
  messages.  Automatically display decrypted content for
  multipart/encrypted messages.  See the emacs variable
  notmuch-crypto-process-mime for more information. Note that this
  needs gpg-agent and a pinentry tool just as the command-line tools.
  Also note there is no support SMIME yet.

Output of pipe command is now displayed if pipe command fails

  This is extremely useful in the common use case of piping a patch to
  "git am". If git fails to cleanly merge the patch the error messages
  from the failed merge are now clearly displayed to the user, (where
  previously they were silently hidden from the user).

User-selectable From address

  A user can choose which configured email addresses should be used as
  the From address whenever composing a new message. To do so, simply
  press C-u before the command which will open a new message. Emacs
  will prompt for the from address to use.

  The user can customize the "Notmuch Identities" setting in the
  notmuch customize group in order to use addresses other than those in
  the notmuch configuration file if desired.

  The user can also choose to always be prompted for the from address
  when composing a new message (without having to use C-u) by setting
  the "Notmuch Always Prompt For Sender" option in the notmuch
  customize group.

Hiding of repeated subjects in collapsed thread view

  In notmuch-show mode, if a collapsed message has the same subject as
  its parent, the subject is not shown.

Automatic detection and hiding of original message in top-posted message

  When a message contains a line looking something like:

        ----- Original Message -----

  emacs hides this and all subsequent lines as an "original message",
  (allowing the user to click or press enter on the "original message"
  button to display it again). This makes the handling of top-posted
  citations work much like conventional citations.

New hooks for running code when tags are modified

  Some users want to perform additional actions whenever a particular
  tag is added/removed from a message. This could be used to, for
  example, interface with some external spam-recognition training
  tool. To facilitate this, two new hooks are added which can be
  modified in the following settings of the notmuch customize group:

        Notmuch Before Tag Hook
        Notmuch After Tag Hook

New optional support for hiding some multipart/alternative parts

  Many emails are sent with redundant content within a
  multipart/alternative group (such as a text/plain part as well as a
  text/html part). Users can configure the setting:

        Notmuch Show All Multipart/Alternative Parts

  to "off" in the notmuch customize group to have the interface
  automatically hide some part alternatives (such as text/html
  parts). This new part hiding is not configured by default yet
  because there's not yet a simple way to re-display such a hidden
  part if it is not actually redundant with a displayed part.

Better rendering of text/x-vcalendar parts

  These parts are now displayed in a format suitable for use with the
  emacs diary.

Avoid getting confused by Subject and Author fields with newline characters

  Replacing all characters with ASCII code less than 32 with a question mark.

Cleaner display of From line in email messages

  Remove double quotes, and drop "name" if it's actually just a repeat of
  the email address.

Vim interface improvements
--------------------------

Felipe Contreras provided a number of updates for the vim interface:

  * Using sendmail directly rather than mailx,
  * Implementing archive in show view
  * Add support to mark as read in show and search views
  * Add delete commands
  * Various cleanups.

Bindings improvements
---------------------

Ruby bindings are now much more complete

  Including `QUERY.sort`, `QUERY.to_s`, `MESSAGE.maildir_flags_to_tags`,
  `MESSAGE.tags_to_maildir_flags`, and `MESSAGE.get_filenames`

Python bindings have been updated and extended

  (docs online at https://notmuch.readthedocs.io/)

  New bindings:

  - `Message().get_filenames()`, `Message().tags_to_maildir_flags()`,
    `Message().maildir_flags_to_tags()`, `list(Threads())` and
    `list(Messages)` works now
  - `Message().__cmp__()` and `__hash__()`

  These allow, for example:

        if msg1 == msg2: ...

  As well as set arithmetic on `Messages()`:

        s1, s2 = set(msgs1), set(msgs2)
        s1.union(s2)
        s2 -= s1

  Removed:

  - `len(Messages())` as it exhausted the iterator

  Use `len(list(Messages()))` or `Query.count_messages()`
  to get the length.

Added initial Go bindings in bindings/go

New build-system features
-------------------------

Added support for building in a directory other than the source directory

  This can be used with the widely-supported idiom of simply running
  the configure script from some other directory:

        mkdir build
        cd build
        ../configure
        make

Fix to save configure options for future, implicit runs of configure

  When a user updates the source (such as with "git pull") calling
  "make" may cause an automatic re-run of the configure script. When
  this happens, the configure script will automatically be called with
  the same options the user originally passed in the most-recent
  manual invocation of configure.

New test-suite feature
----------------------

Binary for bash for running test suite now located via PATH

  The notmuch test suite requires a fairly recent version of bash (>=
  bash 4). As some systems supply an older version of bash at
  /bin/bash, the test suite is now updated to search $PATH to locate
  the bash binary. This allows users of systems with old /bin/bash to
  simply install bash >= 4 somewhere on $PATH before /bin and then use
  the test suite.

Support for testing output with a trailing newline

  Previously, some tests would fail to notice a difference in the
  presence/absence of a trailing newline in a program output, (which
  has led to bugs in the past). Now, carefully-written tests (using
  `test_expect_equal_file` rather than `test_expect_equal`) will detect
  any change in the presence/absence of a trailing newline. Many tests
  are updated to take advantage of this.

Avoiding accessing user's $HOME while running test suite

  The test suite now carefully creates its own HOME directory. This
  allows the test suite to be run with no existing HOME directory, (as
  some build systems apparently do), and avoids test-suite differences
  due to configuration files in the users HOME directory.


General bug fixes
-----------------

Output *all* files for "notmuch search --output=files"

  For the cases where multiple files have the same Message ID,
  previous versions of notmuch would output only one such file. This
  command is now fixed to correctly output all files.

Fixed spurious search results from "overlapped" indexing of addresses

  This fixed a bug where a search for:

        to:user@elsewhere.com

  would incorrectly match a message sent:

        To: user@example,com, someone@elsewhere.com

Fix --output=json when search has no results

  A bug present since notmuch 0.4 had caused searches with no results
  to produce an invalid json object. This is now fixed to cleanly
  return a valid json object representing an empty array "[]" as
  expected.

Fix the automatic detection of the From address for "notmuch reply"
from the Received headers in some cases

Fix core dump on DragonFlyBSD due to -1 return value from
`sysconf(_SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX)`

Cleaned up several memory leaks

Eliminated a few, rare segmentation faults and a double-free

Fix libnotmuch library to only export notmuch API functions

  Previous release of the notmuch library also exported some Xapian
  C++ exception type symbols. These were never part of the library
  interface and were never intended to be exported.

Emacs-interface bug fixes
-------------------------

Display any unexpected output or errors from "notmuch search" invocations

  Previously any misformatted output or trailing error messages were
  silently ignored. This output is now clearly displayed. This fix was
  very helpful in identifying and fixing the bug described below.

Fix bug where some threads would be missing from large search results

  When a search returned a "large" number of results, the emacs
  interface was incorrectly dropping one thread every time the output
  of the "notmuch search" process spanned the emacs read-buffer. This
  is now fixed.

Avoid re-compression of .gz files (and similar) when saving attachment

  Emacs was being too clever for its own good and trying to
  re-compress pre-compressed .gz files when saving such attachments
  (potentially corrupting the attachment). The emacs interface is
  fixed to avoid this bug.

Fix hiding of a message when a previously-hidden citation is visible

  Previously the citation would remain visible in this case. This is
  fixed so that hiding a message hides all parts.

Notmuch 0.5 (2010-11-11)
========================

New, general features
---------------------

Maildir-flag synchronization

  Notmuch now knows how to synchronize flags in maildir filenames with
  tags in the notmuch database. The following flag/tag mappings are
  supported:

        Flag <-> Tag
        ----     -----
        'D'      draft
        'F'      flagged
        'P'      passed
        'R'      replied
        'S'      unread (added when 'S' flag is not present)

  The synchronization occurs in both directions, (for example, adding
  the 'S' flag to a file will cause the "unread" tag to be added, and
  adding the "replied" tag to a message will cause the file to be
  renamed with an 'R' flag).

  This synchronization is enabled by default for users of the
  command-line interface, (though only files in directories named
  "cur" or "new" will be renamed). It can be disabled by setting the
  new `maildir.synchronize_flags` option in the configuration file. For
  example:

        notmuch config set maildir.synchronize_flags false

  Users upgrading may also want to run "notmuch setup" once (just
  accept the existing configuration) to get a new, nicely-commented
  [maildir] section added to the configuration file.

  For users of the notmuch library, the new synchronization
  functionality is available with the following two new functions:

        notmuch_message_maildir_flags_to_tags
        notmuch_message_tags_to_maildir_flags

  It is anticipated that future improvements to this support will
  allow for safe synchronization of the 'T' flag with the "deleted"
  tag, as well as support for custom flag/tag mappings.

New library features
--------------------

Support for querying multiple filenames for a single message

  It is common for the mailstore to contain multiple files with the
  same message ID. Previously, notmuch would always hide these
  duplicate files, (returning a single, arbitrary filename with
  `notmuch_message_get_filename`).

  With this release, library users can access all filenames for a
  message with the new function:

        notmuch_message_get_filenames

  Together with `notmuch_filenames_valid`, `notmuch_filenames_get`,
  and `notmuch_filenames_move_to_next` it is now possible to iterate
  over all available filenames for a given message.

New command-line features
-------------------------

New "notmuch show --format=raw" for getting at original email contents

  This new feature allows for a fully-functional email client to be
  built on top of the notmuch command-line without needing any direct
  access to the mail store itself.

  For example, it's now possible to run "emacs -f notmuch" on a local
  machine with only ssh access to the mail store/notmuch database. To
  do this, simply set the notmuch-command variable in emacs to the
  name of a script containing:

        ssh user@host notmuch "$@"

  If the ssh client has enabled connection sharing (ControlMaster
  option in OpenSSH), the emacs interface can be quite responsive this
  way.

General bug fixes
-----------------

Fix "notmuch search" to print nothing when nothing matches

  The 0.4 release had a bug in which:

        notmuch search <expression-with-no-matches>

  would produce a single blank line of output, (where previous
  versions would produce no output. This fix also causes a change in
  the --format=json output, (which would previously produce "[]" and
  now produces nothing).

Emacs interface improvements
----------------------------

Fix to allow pipe ('|') command to work when using notmuch over ssh

Fix count of lines in hidden signatures

Omit repeated subject lines in (collapsed) thread display

Display current thread subject in a header line

Provide a "c i" binding to copy a thread ID from the search view

Allow for notmuch-fcc-dirs to have a value of nil

  Also, the more complex form of notmuch-fcc-dirs now has a slightly
  different format. It no longer has a special first-element, fallback
  string. Instead it's now a list of cons cells where the car of each
  cell is a regular expression to be matched against the sender
  address, and the cdr is the name of a folder to use for an FCC. So
  the old fallback behavior can be achieved by including a final cell
  of (".*" . "default-fcc-folder").

Vim interface improvements
--------------------------

Felipe Contreras provided a number of updates for the vim interface

  These include optimizations, support for newer versions of vim, fixed
  support for sending mail on modern systems, new commands, and
  various cleanups.

New bindings
------------

Added initial ruby bindings in bindings/ruby

Notmuch 0.4 (2010-11-01)
========================

New command-line features
-------------------------

`notmuch search --output=(summary|threads|messages|tags|files)`

  This new option allows for particular items to be returned from
  notmuch searches. The "summary" option is the default and behaves
  just as "notmuch search" has historically behaved.

  The new option values allow for thread IDs, message IDs, lists of
  tags, and lists of filenames to be returned from searches. It is
  expected that this new option will be very useful in shell
  scripts. For example:

        for file in $(notmuch search --output=files <search-terms>); do
                <operations-on> "$file"
        done

`notmuch show --format=mbox <search-specification>`

  This new option allows for the messages matching a search
  specification to be presented as an mbox. Specifically the "mboxrd"
  format is used which allows for reversible quoting of lines
  beginning with "From ". A reader should remove a single '>' from the
  beginning of all lines beginning with one or more '>' characters
  followed by the 5 characters "From ".

`notmuch config [get|set] <section>.<item> [value ...]`

  The new top-level "config" command allows for any value in the
  notmuch configuration file to be queried or set to a new value. Both
  single-valued and multi-valued items are supported, as our any
  custom items stored in the configuration file.

Avoid setting Bcc header in "notmuch reply"

  We decided that this was a bit heavy-handed as the actual mail
  user-agent should be responsible for setting any Bcc option. Also,
  see below for the notmuch/emacs user-agent now setting an Fcc by
  default rather than Bcc.

New library features
--------------------

Add `notmuch_query_get_query_string` and `notmuch_query_get_sort`

  These are simply functions for querying properties of a
  `notmuch_query_t` object.

New emacs features
------------------

Enable Fcc of all sent messages by default (to "sent" directory)

  All messages sent from the emacs interface will now be saved to the
  notmuch mail store where they will be incorporated to the database
  by the next "notmuch new". By default, messages are saved to the
  "sent" directory at the top-level of the mail store. This directory
  can be customized by means of the "Notmuch Fcc Dirs" option in the
  notmuch customize interface.

Ability to all open messages in a thread to a pipe

  Historically, the '|' keybinding allows for piping a single message
  to an external command. Now, by prefixing this key with a prefix
  argument, (for example, by pressing "Control-U |"), all open
  messages in the current thread will be sent to the external command.

Optional support for detecting inline patches

  This hook is disabled by default but can be enabled with a checkbox
  under "Notmuch Show Insert Text/Plain Hook" in the notmuch customize
  interface. It allows for inline patches to be detected and treated
  as if they were attachments, (with context-sensitive highlighting).

Automatically tag messages as "replied" when sending a reply

  Messages replied to within the emacs interface will now be tagged as
  "replied". This feature can easily be customized to add or remove
  other tags as well. For example, a user might use a tag of
  "needs-reply" and can configure this feature to automatically remove
  that tag when replying. See "Notmuch Message Mark Replied" in the
  notmuch customize interface.

Allow search-result color specifications to overlay each other

  For example, one tag can specify the background color of matching
  lines, while another can specify the foreground. With this change,
  both settings will now be visible simultaneously, (which was not the
  case in previous releases). See "Notmuch Search Line Faces" in the
  notmuch customize interface.

Make hidden author names still available for incremental search

  When there is insufficient space to display all authors of a thread
  in search results, the names of hidden authors are now still made
  available to emacs' incremental search commands. As the user
  searches, matching lines will temporarily expand to show the hidden
  names.

New binding of Control-TAB (works like TAB in reverse)

  Many notmuch nodes already use TAB to navigate forward through
  various items allowing actions, (message headers, email attachments,
  etc.). The new Control-TAB binding operates similarly but in the
  opposite direction.

New build-system features
-------------------------

Various portability fixes have been applied

  These include fixes for build failures on at least Solaris, FreeBSD,
  and Fedora systems. We're hopeful that the notmuch code base is now
  more portable than ever before.

Arrange for libnotmuch to be found automatically after make install

  The notmuch build system is now careful to help the user avoid
  errors of the form "libnotmuch.so could not be found" immediately
  after installing. This support takes two forms:

  1. If the library is installed to a system directory,
     (configured in /etc/ld.so.conf), then "make install" will
     automatically run ldconfig.

  2. If the library is installed to a non-system directory, the
     build system adds a `DR_RUNPATH` entry to the final binary
     pointing to the directory to which the library is installed.

  When this support works, the user should be able to run notmuch
  immediately after "make install", without any errors trying to find
  the notmuch library, and without having to manually set environment
  variables such as `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

Check compiler/linker options before using them

  The configure script now carefully checks that any desired
  compilation options, (whether for enabling compiler warnings, or for
  embedding rpath, etc.), are supported. Only supported options are
  used in the resulting Makefile.

New test-suite features
-----------------------

New modularization of test suite

  Thanks to a gracious relicensing of the test-suite infrastructure
  from the git project, notmuch now has a modular test suite. This
  provides the ability to run individual sections of the test suite
  rather than the whole things. It also provides better summary of
  test results, with support for tests that are expected to fail
  (BROKEN and FIXED) in addition to PASS and FAIL. Finally, it makes
  it easy to run the test suite within valgrind (pass --valgrind to
  notmuch-test or to any sub-script) which has been very useful.

New testing of emacs interface

  The test suite has been augmented to allow automated testing of the
  emacs interfaces. So far, this includes basic searches, display of
  threads, and tag manipulation. This also includes a test that a new
  message can successfully be sent out through a (dummy) SMTP server
  and that said message is successfully integrated into the notmuch
  database via the FCC setting.

General bug fixes
-----------------

Fix potential corruption of database when "notmuch new" is interrupted

  Previously, an interruption of "notmuch new" would (rarely) result
  in a corrupt database. The corruption would manifest itself by a
  persistent error of the form:

        document ID of 1234 has no thread ID

  The message-adding code has been carefully audited and reworked to
  avoid this sort of corruption regardless of when it is interrupted.

Fix failure with extremely long message ID headers

  Previously, a message with an extremely long message ID, (say, more
  than 300 characters), would fail to be added to notmuch, (triggering
  Xapian exceptions). This has now been fixed.

Fix for messages with "charset=unknown-8bit"

  Previously, messages with this charset would cause notmuch to emit a
  GMime warning, (which would then trip up emacs or other interfaces
  parsing the notmuch results).

Fix `notmuch_query_search_threads` function to return NULL on any exception

Fix "notmuch search" to return non-zero if `notmuch_query_search_threads`
fails

  Previously, this command could confusingly report a Xapian
  exception, yet still return an error code of 0. It now correctly
  returns a failing error code of 1 in this case.

Emacs bug fixes
---------------

Fix to handle a message with a subject containing, for example "[1234]"

  Previously, a message subject containing a sequence of digits within
  square brackets would cause the emacs interface to mis-parse the
  output of "notmuch search". This would result in the message being
  mis-displayed and prevent the user from manipulating the message in
  the emacs interface.

Fix to correctly handle message IDs containing ".."

  The emacs interface now properly quotes message IDs to avoid a
  Xapian bug in which the ".." within a message ID would be
  misinterpreted as a numeric range specification.

Python-binding fixes
--------------------

The python bindings for notmuch have been updated to work with python3.

Debian-specific fixes
---------------------

Fix emacs initialization so "M-x notmuch" works for users by default

  Now, a new Debian user can immediately run "emacs -f notmuch" after
  "apt-get install notmuch". Previously, the user would have had to
  edit the ~/.emacs file to add "(require 'notmuch)" before this would
  work.

Notmuch 0.3.1 (2010-04-27)
==========================

General bug fixes
-----------------

Fix an infinite loop in "notmuch reply"

  This bug could be triggered by replying to a message where the
  user's primary email address did not appear in the To: header and
  the user had not configured any secondary email addresses. The bug
  was a simple re-use of the same iterator variable in nested loops.

Fix a potential SEGV in "notmuch search"

  This bug could be triggered by an author name ending in a ','.
  Admittedly - that's almost certainly a spam email, but we never
  want notmuch to crash.

Emacs bug fixes
---------------

Fix calculations for line wrapping in the primary "notmuch" view

Fix Fcc support to prompt to create a directory if the specified Fcc
directory does not exist

Build fix
---------

Fix build on OpenSolaris (at least) due to missing 'extern "C"' block

  Without this, the C++ sources could not find strcasestr and the
  final linking of notmuch would fail.

Notmuch 0.3 (2010-04-27)
========================

New command-line features
-------------------------

User-configurable tags for new messages

  A new "new.tags" option is available in the configuration file to
  determine which tags are applied to new messages. Run "notmuch
  setup" to generate new documentation within ~/.notmuch-config on how
  to specify this value.

Threads search results named based on subjects that match search

  This means that when new mails arrived to a thread you've previously
  read, and the new mails have a new subject, you will see that
  subject in the search results rather than the old subject.

Faster operation of "notmuch tag" (avoid unneeded sorting)

  Since the user just wants to tag all matching messages, we can make
  things perform a bit faster by avoiding the sort.

Even Better guessing of From: header for "notmuch reply"

  Notmuch now looks at a number of headers when trying to figure out
  the best From: header to use in a reply. This is helpful if you have
  several configured email addresses, and you also subscribe to various
  mailing lists with different addresses, (so that mails you are
  replying to won't always include your subscribed address in the To:
  header).

Indication of author names that match a search

  When notmuch displays threads as the result of a search, it now
  lists the authors that match the search before listing the other
  authors in the thread. It inserts a pipe '|' symbol between the last
  matching and first non-matching author. This is especially useful in
  a search that includes tag:unread. Now the authors of the unread
  messages in the thread are listed first.

New: Python bindings
--------------------

Sebastian Spaeth has contributed his python bindings for the notmuch
library to the central repository. These bindings were previously
known as "cnotmuch" within python but have now been renamed to be
accessible with a simple, and more official-looking "import notmuch".

The bindings have already proven very useful as people proficient in
python have been able to easily develop programs to do notmuch-based
searches for email-address completion, maildir-flag synchronization,
and other tasks.

These bindings are available within the bindings/python directory, but
are not yet integrated into the top-level Makefiles, nor the top-level
package-building scripts. Improvements are welcome.

Emacs interface improvements
----------------------------

An entirely new initial view for notmuch, (friendly yet powerful)

  Some of us call the new view "notmuch hello" but you can get at it
  by simply calling "emacs -f notmuch". The new view provides a search
  bar where new searches can be performed. It also displays a list of
  recent searches, along with a button to save any of these, giving it
  a new name as a "saved search". Many people find these "saved
  searches" one of the most convenient ways of organizing their mail,
  (providing all of the features of "folders" in other mail clients,
  but without any of the disadvantages).

  Finally, this view can also optionally display all of the tags that
  exist in the database, along with a count for each tag, and a custom
  search of messages with that tag that's simply a click (or keypress)
  away.

  NOTE: For users that liked the original mode of "emacs -f notmuch"
  immediately displaying a particular search result, we recommend
  instead running something like:

        emacs --eval '(notmuch search "tag:inbox" t)'

  The "t" means to sort the messages in an "oldest first" order,
  (as notmuch would do previously by default). You can also
  leave that off to have your search results in "newest first"
  order.

Full-featured "customize" support for configuring notmuch

  Notmuch now plugs in well to the emacs "customize" mode to make it
  much simpler to find things about the notmuch interface that can be
  tweaked by the user.

  You can get to this mode by starting at the main "Customize" menu in
  emacs, then browsing through "Applications", "Mail", and
  "Notmuch". Or you can go straight to "M-x customize-group"
  "notmuch".

  Once you're at the customize screen, you'll see a list of documented
  options that can be manipulated along with checkboxes, drop-down
  selectors, and text-entry boxes for configuring the various
  settings.

Support for doing tab-completion of email addresses

  This support currently relies on an external program,
  (notmuch-addresses), that is not yet shipped with notmuch
  itself. But multiple, suitable implementations of this program have
  already been written that generate address completions by doing
  notmuch searches of your email collection. For example, providing
  first those addresses that you have composed messages to in the
  past, etc.

  One such program (implemented in python with the python bindings to
  notmuch) is available via:

        git clone  http://jkr.acm.jhu.edu/git/notmuch_addresses.git

  Install that program as notmuch-addresses on your PATH, and then
  hitting TAB on a partial email address or name within the To: or Cc:
  line of an email message will provide matching completions.

Support for file-based (Fcc) delivery of sent messages to mail store

  This isn't yet enabled by default. To enable this, one will have to
  set the "Notmuch Fcc Dirs" setting within the notmuch customize
  screen, (see its documentation there for details). We anticipate
  making this automatic in a future release.

New 'G' key binding to trigger mail refresh (G == "Get new mail")

  The 'G' key works wherever '=' works. Before refreshing the screen
  it calls an external program that can be used to poll email servers,
  run notmuch new and set up specific tags for the new emails. The
  script to be called should be configured with the "Notmuch Poll
  Script" setting in the customize interface. This script will
  typically invoke "notmuch new" and then perhaps several "notmuch
  tag" commands.

Implement emacs message display with the JSON output from notmuch

  This is much more robust than the previous implementation, (where
  some HTML mails and mail quoting the notmuch code with the delimiter
  characters in it would cause the parser to fall over).

Better handling of HTML messages and MIME attachments (inline images!)

  Allow for any MIME parts that emacs can display to be displayed
  inline. This includes inline viewing of image attachments, (provided
  the window is large enough to fit the image at its natural size).

  Much more robust handling of HTML messages. Currently both text/plain
  and text/html alternates will be rendered next to each other. In a
  future release, users will be able to decide to see only one or the
  other representation.

  Each attachment now has its own button so that attachments can be
  saved individually (the 'w' key is still available to save all
  attachments).

Customizable support for tidying of text/plain message content

  Many new functions are available for tidying up message
  content. These include options such as wrapping long lines,
  compressing duplicate blank lines, etc.

  Most of these are disabled by default, but can easily be enabled by
  clicking the available check boxes under the "Notmuch Show Insert
  Text/Plain Hook" within the notmuch customize screen.

New support for searchable citations (even when hidden)

  When portions of overly-long citations are hidden, the contents of
  these citations will still be available for emacs' standard
  "incremental search" functions. When the search matches any portion
  of a hidden citation, the citation will become visible temporarily
  to display the search result.

More flexible handling of header visibility

  As an answer to complaints from many users, the To, Cc, and Date
  headers of messages are no longer hidden by default. For those users
  that liked that these were hidden, a new "Notmuch Messages Headers
  Visible" option in the customize interface can be set to nil. The
  visibility of headers can still be toggled on a per-message basis
  with the 'h' keybinding.

  For users that don't want to see some subset of those headers, the
  new "Notmuch Message Headers" variable can be customized to list
  only those headers that should be present in the display of a message.

The Return key now toggles message visibility anywhere

  Previously this worked only on the first summary-line of a message.

Customizable formatting of search results

  The user can easily customize the order, width, and formatting of
  the various fields in a "notmuch search" buffer. See the "Notmuch
  Search Result Format" section of the customize interface.

Generate nicer names for search buffers when using a saved search

Add a notmuch User-Agent header when sending mail from notmuch/emacs

New keybinding (M-Ret) to open all collapsed messages in a thread

New library feature
-------------------

Provide a new `NOTMUCH_SORT_UNSORTED` value for queries

  This can be somewhat faster when sorting simply isn't desired. For
  example when collecting a set of messages that will all be
  manipulated identically, (adding a tag, removing a tag, deleting the
  messages), then there's no advantage to sorting the messages by
  date.

Build fixes
-----------

Fix to compile against GMime 2.6

  Previously notmuch insisted on being able to find GMime 2.4, (even
  though GMime 2.6 would have worked all along).

Fix configure script to accept (and ignore) various standard options

  For example, those that the Gentoo build scripts expect configure to
  accept are now all accepted.

Test suite
----------

A large number of new tests for the many new features

Better display of output from failed tests

  Now shows failures with diff rather than forcing the user to gaze at
  complete actual and expected output looking for deviation.

Notmuch 0.2 (2010-04-16)
========================

This is the second release of the notmuch mail system, with actual
detailed release notes this time!

This release consists of a number of minor new features that make
notmuch more pleasant to use, and a few fairly major bug fixes.

We didn't quite hit our release target of "about a week" from the 0.1
release, (0.2 is happening 11 days after 0.1), but we hope to do
better for next week. Look forward to some major features coming to
notmuch in subsequent releases.

-Carl

General features
----------------

Better guessing of From: header

  Notmuch now tries harder to guess which configured address should be
  used as the From: line in a "notmuch reply". It will examine the
  Received: headers if it fails to find any configured address in To:
  or Cc:. This allows it to often choose the correct address even when
  replying to a message sent to a mailing list, and not directly to a
  configured address.

Make "notmuch count" with no arguments count all messages

  Previously, it was hard to construct a search term that was
  guaranteed to match all messages.

Provide a new special-case search term of "*" to match all messages

  This can be used in any command accepting a search term, such as
  "notmuch search '*'". Note that you'll want to take care that the
  shell doesn't expand * against the current files. And note that the
  support for "*" is a special case. It's only meaningful as a single
  search term and loses its special meaning when combined with any
  other search terms.

Automatically detect thread connections even when a parent message is
missing

  Previously, if two or more message were received with a common
  parent, but that parent was not received, then these messages would
  not be recognized as belonging to the same thread. This is now fixed
  so that such messages are properly connected in a thread.

General bug fixes
-----------------

Fix potential data loss in "notmuch new" with SIGINT

  One code path in "notmuch new" was not properly handling
  SIGINT. Previously, this could lead to messages being removed from
  the database (and their tags being lost) if the user pressed
  Control-C while "notmuch new" was working.

Fix segfault when a message includes a MIME part that is empty

Fix handling of non-ASCII characters with --format=json

  Previously, characters outside the range of 7-bit ASCII were
  silently dropped from the JSON output. This led to corrupted display
  of utf-8 content in the upcoming notmuch web-based frontends.

Fix headers to be properly decoded in "notmuch reply"

  Previously, the user might see:

        Subject: Re: =?iso-8859-2?q?Rozlu=E8ka?=

  rather than:

        Subject: Re: Rozlučka

  The former text is properly encoded to be RFC-compliant SMTP, will
  be sent correctly, and will be properly decoded by the
  recipient. But the user trying to edit the reply would likely be
  unable to read or edit that field in its encoded form.

Emacs client features
---------------------

Show the last few lines of citations as well as the first few lines

  It's often the case that the last sentence of a citation is what is
  being replied to directly, so the last few lines are often much more
  important. The number of lines shown at the beginning and end of any
  citation can be configured, (notmuch-show-citation-lines-prefix and
  notmuch-show-citation-lines-suffix).

The '+' and '-' commands in the search view can now add and remove
tags by region

  Selective bulk tagging is now possible by selecting a region of
  threads and then using either the '+' or '-' keybindings. Bulk
  tagging is still available for all threads matching the current
  search with the '*' binding.

More meaningful buffer names for thread-view buffers

  Notmuch now uses the Subject of the thread as the buffer
  name. Previously it was using the thread ID, which is a meaningless
  number to the user.

Provide for customized colors of threads in search view based on tags

  See the documentation of notmuch-search-line-faces, (or us "M-x
  customize" and browse to the "notmuch" group within "Applications"
  and "Mail"), for details on how to configure this colorization.

Build-system features
---------------------

Add support to properly build libnotmuch on Darwin systems (OS X)

Add support to configure for many standard options

  We include actual support for:

        --includedir --mandir --sysconfdir

  And accept and silently ignore several more:

        --build --infodir --libexecdir --localstatedir
        --disable-maintainer-mode --disable-dependency-tracking

Install emacs client in "make install" rather than requiring a
separate "make install-emacs"

Automatically compute versions numbers between releases

  This support uses the git-describe notation, so a version such as
  0.1-144-g43cbbfc indicates a version that is 144 commits since the
  0.1 release and is available as git commit "43cbbfc".

Add a new "make test" target to run the test suite and actually
verify its results

Notmuch 0.1 (2010-04-05)
========================

This is the first release of the notmuch mail system.

It includes the libnotmuch library, the notmuch command-line
interface, and an emacs-based interface to notmuch.

Note: Notmuch will work best with Xapian 1.0.18 (or later) or Xapian
1.1.4 (or later). Previous versions of Xapian (whether 1.0 or 1.1) had
a performance bug that made notmuch very slow when modifying
tags. This would cause distracting pauses when reading mail while
notmuch would wait for Xapian when removing the "inbox" and "unread"
tags from messages in a thread.
