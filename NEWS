Visualization of author names that match a search

  When notmuch displays threads as the result of a search, it now
  lists the authors that match the search before listing the other
  authors in the thread. It inserts a pipe '|' symbol between the last
  matching and first non-matching author. This is especially useful in
  a search that includes tag:unread. Now the authors of the unread
  messages in the thread are listed first.

Notmuch 0.2 (2010-04-16)
========================
This is the second release of the notmuch mail system, with actual
detailed release notes this time!

This release consists of a number of minor new features that make
notmuch more pleasant to use, and a few fairly major bug fixes.

We didn't quite hit our release target of "about a week" from the 0.1
release, (0.2 is happening 11 days after 0.1), but we hope to do
better for next week. Look forward to some major features coming to
notmuch in subsequent releases.

General features
----------------
Better guessing of From: header.

  Notmuch now tries harder to guess which configured address should be
  used as the From: line in a "notmuch reply". It will examine the
  Received: headers if it fails to find any configured address in To:
  or Cc:. This allows it to often choose the correct address even when
  replying to a message sent to a mailing list, and not directly to a
  configured address.

Make "notmuch count" with no arguments count all messages

  Previously, it was hard to construct a search term that was
  guaranteed to match all messages.

Provide a new special-case search term of "*" to match all messages.

  This can be used in any command accepting a search term, such as
  "notmuch search '*'". Note that you'll want to take care that the
  shell doesn't expand * against the current files. And note that the
  support for "*" is a special case. It's only meaningful as a single
  search term and loses its special meaning when combined with any
  other search terms.

Automatically detect thread connections even when a parent message is
missing.

  Previously, if two or more message were received with a common
  parent, but that parent was not received, then these messages would
  not be recognized as belonging to the same thread. This is now fixed
  so that such messages are properly connected in a thread.

General bug fixes
-----------------
Fix potential data loss in "notmuch new" with SIGINT

  One code path in "notmuch new" was not properly handling
  SIGINT. Previously, this could lead to messages being removed from
  the database (and their tags being lost) if the user pressed
  Control-C while "notmuch new" was working.

Fix segfault when a message includes a MIME part that is empty.

Fix handling of non-ASCII characters with --format=json

  Previously, characters outside the range of 7-bit ASCII were
  silently dropped from the JSON output. This led to corrupted display
  of utf-8 content in the upcoming notmuch web-based frontends.

Fix headers to be properly decoded in "notmuch reply"

  Previously, the user might see:

	Subject: Re: =?iso-8859-2?q?Rozlu=E8ka?=

  rather than:

	Subject: Re: Rozlučka

  The former text is properly encoded to be RFC-compliant SMTP, will
  be sent correctly, and will be properly decoded by the
  recipient. But the user trying to edit the reply would likely be
  unable to read or edit that field in its encoded form.

Emacs client features
---------------------
Show the last few lines of citations as well as the first few lines.

  It's often the case that the last sentence of a citation is what is
  being replied to directly, so the last few lines are often much more
  important. The number of lines shown at the beginning and end of any
  citation can be configured, (notmuch-show-citation-lines-prefix and
  notmuch-show-citation-lines-suffix).

The '+' and '-' commands in the search view can now add and remove
tags by region.

  Selective bulk tagging is now possible by selecting a region of
  threads and then using either the '+' or '-' keybindings. Bulk
  tagging is still available for all threads matching the current
  search with th '*' binding.

More meaningful buffer names for thread-view buffers.

  Notmuch now uses the Subject of the thread as the buffer
  name. Previously it was using the thread ID, which is a meaningless
  number to the user.

Provide for customized colors of threads in search view based on tags.

  See the documentation of notmuch-search-line-faces, (or us "M-x
  customize" and browse to the "notmuch" group within "Applications"
  and "Mail"), for details on how to configure this colorization.

Build-system features
---------------------
Add support to properly build libnotmuch on Darwin systems (OS X).

Add support to configure for many standard options.

  We include actual support for:

	--includedir --mandir --sysconfdir

  And accept and silently ignore several more:

	--build --infodir --libexecdir --localstatedir
	--disable-maintainer-mode --disable-dependency-tracking

Install emacs client in "make install" rather than requiring a
separate "make install-emacs".

Automatically compute versions numbers between releases.

  This support uses the git-describe notation, so a version such as
  0.1-144-g43cbbfc indicates a version that is 144 commits since the
  0.1 release and is available as git commit "43cbbfc".

Add a new "make test" target to run the test suite and actually verify
its results.

Notmuch 0.1 (2010-04-05)
========================
This is the first release of the notmuch mail system.

It includes the libnotmuch library, the notmuch command-line
interface, and an emacs-based interface to notmuch.

Note: Notmuch will work best with Xapian 1.0.18 (or later) or Xapian
1.1.4 (or later). Previous versions of Xapian (whether 1.0 or 1.1) had
a performance bug that made notmuch very slow when modifying
tags. This would cause distracting pauses when reading mail while
notmuch would wait for Xapian when removing the "inbox" and "unread"
tags from messages in a thread.
