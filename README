Notmuch - thread-based email index, search and tagging.

Notmuch is a system for indexing, searching, reading, and tagging
large collections of email messages. It uses the Xapian library to
provide fast, full-text search of very large collection of email with
a very convenient search syntax.

Notmuch is free software, released under the GNU General Public
License version 3 (or later).

Interface options
-----------------
Notmuch includes a "notmuch" command-line interface to the system.
This is not a very convenient interface and it is not expected that
users will find it satisfying. Instead, there are two option for
obtaining a more sophisticated interface:

     1. Build on top of the "notmuch" command-line interface.

	This might be a reasonable option for a very text-oriented
	client environment. For example, an emacs-based interface for
	notmuch is already under development and is available in the
	notmuch.el file in this distribution.

	If someone were to write a curses-based interface, or similar,
	it might also be reasonable to build on the "notmuch"
	command-line interface.

     2. Build on top of the notmuch library interface.

	This is a better choice for developing an interface that has
	full control of the presentation of email threads and
	messages. It is expected that anyone integrating Notmuch into
	an existing, graphical email program use the notmuch library
	interface.

	The public interface to the notmuch library is contained in
	the notmuch.h header file. The "notmuch" command-line program
	in notmuch.c can be used as good example code, since it is a
	simple program that is written on top of the library
	interface.

As can be seen, alternate interfaces to the Notmuch mail system are
still in development. We would appreciate any contributions to these
efforts.
