TODO FOR NOTMUCH-PICK

(These are the things I can think of: to be added to as problems get
reported or found!)

Things that need fixing before acceptance to mainline

- Review lisp to make idiomatic.
- Unify functions with search or show where appropriate.
- Work out a fall-back if the font does not contain box graphic characters.
- Add extra functionality?

- Remove debugging information.

- Add tests (I have some but I am not sure how to add them if pick is
  in contrib).

Bugs:

- The display flickers while pick is running. I have no idea why.

Other todo items

- c i, c f for stashing ids etc.

- Perhaps the author should be "To: ???" if the message is from the user.

- Is there some nice way to do use the expand citation buttons of
  notmuch-show when using the split-pane mode?
