This file describes the schemata used for notmuch's structured output
format (currently JSON and S-Expressions).

[]'s indicate lists.  List items can be marked with a '?', meaning
they are optional; or a '*', meaning there can be zero or more of that
item.  {}'s indicate an object that maps from field identifiers to
values.  An object field marked '?' is optional.  |'s indicate
alternates (e.g., int|string means something can be an int or a
string).

For S-Expression output, lists are printed delimited by () instead of
[]. Objects are printed as p-lists, i.e. lists where the keys and values
are interleaved. Keys are printed as keywords (symbols preceded by a
colon), e.g. (:id "123" :time 54321 :from "foobar"). Null is printed as
nil, true as t and false as nil.

This is version 1 of the structured output format.
