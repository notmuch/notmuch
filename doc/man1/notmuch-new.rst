SYNOPSIS
========

**notmuch** **new** [options]

DESCRIPTION
===========

Find and import any new messages to the database.

The **new** command scans all sub-directories of the database,
performing full-text indexing on new messages that are found. Each new
message will automatically be tagged with both the **inbox** and
**unread** tags.

You should run **notmuch new** once after first running
:any:`notmuch-setup(1)` to create the initial database. The first run
may take a long time if you have a significant amount of mail (several
hundred thousand messages or more). Subsequently, you should run
**notmuch new** whenever new mail is delivered and you wish to
incorporate it into the database.  These subsequent runs will be much
quicker than the initial run.

Invoking ``notmuch`` with no command argument will run **new** if
:any:`notmuch-setup(1)` has previously been completed, but **notmuch
new** has not previously been run.

**notmuch new** updates tags according to maildir flag changes if the
**maildir.synchronize\_flags** configuration option is enabled. See
:any:`notmuch-config(1)` for details.

The **new** command supports hooks. See :any:`notmuch-hooks(5)` for more
details on hooks.

Supported options for **new** include

.. program:: new

.. option:: --no-hooks

   Prevents hooks from being run.

.. option:: --quiet

   Do not print progress or results.

.. option:: --verbose

   Print file names being processed. Ignored when combined with
   ``--quiet``.

.. option:: --decrypt=(true|nostash|auto|false)

   If ``true``, when encountering an encrypted message, try to
   decrypt it while indexing, and stash any discovered session keys.
   If ``auto``, try to use any session key already known to belong to
   this message, but do not attempt to use the user's secret keys.
   If decryption is successful, index the cleartext of the message.

   Be aware that the index is likely sufficient (and the session key
   is certainly sufficient) to reconstruct the cleartext of the
   message itself, so please ensure that the notmuch message index is
   adequately protected.  DO NOT USE ``--decrypt=true`` or
   ``--decrypt=nostash`` without considering the security of your
   index.

   See also ``index.decrypt`` in :any:`notmuch-config(1)`.

.. option:: --full-scan

   By default notmuch-new uses directory modification times (mtimes)
   to optimize the scanning of directories for new mail. This option turns
   that optimization off.

CONFIGURATION
=============

Indexing is influenced by the configuration options
:ref:`index.decrypt <index.decrypt>`, :ref:`index.header
<index.header>`, and :ref:`new.ignore <new.ignore>`.  Tagging
is controlled by :ref:`new.tags <new.tags>` and
:ref:`maildir.synchronize_flags <maildir.synchronize_flags>`.  See
:any:`notmuch-config(1)` for details.

EXIT STATUS
===========

This command supports the following special exit status code

``75 (EX_TEMPFAIL)``
    A temporary failure occurred; the user is invited to retry.
