About this Manual
=================

This manual covers only the Emacs interface to Notmuch. For information
on the command line interface, see section “Description” in the Notmuch
Manual Pages. To save typing, we will sometimes use *notmuch* in this
manual to refer to the Emacs interface to Notmuch. When this distinction
is important, we’ll refer to the Emacs interface as
*notmuch-emacs*.

Notmuch-emacs is highly customizable via the the Emacs customization
framework (or just by setting the appropriate variables). We try to
point out relevant variables in this manual, but in order to avoid
duplication of information, you can usually find the most detailed
description in the variables' docstring.

notmuch-hello
=============

.. index::
   single: notmuch-hello
   single: notmuch

``notmuch-hello`` is the main entry point for Notmuch. You can start it
with ``M-x notmuch`` or ``M-x notmuch-hello``. The startup screen looks
something like the following. There are some hints at the bottom of the
screen. There are three main parts to the notmuch-hello screen,
discussed below. The **bold** text indicates buttons you can click with
a mouse or by positioning the cursor and pressing ``<return>``

|   Welcome to **notmuch** You have 52 messages.
|
| Saved searches: **[edit]**
|
|	  52 **inbox**           52 **unread**
|
| Search: ____________________________________
|
| All tags: **[show]**
|
|	 Hit \`?' for context-sensitive help in any Notmuch screen.

You can change the overall appearance of the notmuch-hello screen by
customizing the variable :index:`notmuch-hello-sections`.

.. _saved-searches:

Saved Searches
--------------

Since notmuch is entirely search-based, it's often useful to organize
mail around common searches.  To facilitate this, the first section of
notmuch-hello presents a customizable set of saved searches.  Saved
searches can also be accessed from anywhere in notmuch by pressing
``j`` to access :ref:`notmuch-jump`.

The saved searches default to various common searches such as
``tag:inbox`` to access the inbox and ``tag:unread`` to access all
unread mail, but there are several options for customization:

:index:`notmuch-saved-searches`
    The list of saved searches, including names, queries, and
    additional per-query options.

:index:`notmuch-saved-search-sort-function`
    This variable controls how saved searches should be sorted. A value
    of ``nil`` displays the saved searches in the order they are stored
    in ‘notmuch-saved-searches’.

:index:`notmuch-column-control`
    Controls the number of columns for displaying saved-searches/tags

Search Box
----------

The search box lets the user enter a Notmuch query. See section
“Description” in Notmuch Query Syntax, for more info on Notmuch query
syntax. A history of recent searches is also displayed by default. The
latter is controlled by the variable :index:`notmuch-hello-recent-searches-max`.

Known Tags
----------

One special kind of saved search provided by default is for each
individual tag defined in the database. This can be controlled via the
following variables.

:index:`notmuch-hello-tag-list-make-query`
    Control how to construct a search (“virtual folder”) from a given
    tag.

:index:`notmuch-hello-hide-tags`
    Which tags not to display at all.

:index:`notmuch-column-control`
    Controls the number of columns for displaying saved-searches/tags

.. _notmuch-search:

notmuch-search
==============

``notmuch-search-mode`` is used to display the results from executing
a query via ``notmuch-search``. The syntax for these queries is the
the same as :ref:`saved-searches`. For details of this syntax see
info:notmuch-search-terms

By default the output approximates that of the command line See section
“Description” in notmuch search command.

The main purpose of the ``notmuch-search-mode`` buffer is to act as a
menu of results that the user can explore further by pressing
``<return>`` on the appropriate line.

``n,C-n,<down>``
    Move to next line

``p,C-p,<up>``
    Move to previous line

``<return>``
    Open thread on current line in :ref:`notmuch-show` mode

``g`` ``=``
    Refresh the buffer

``?``
    Display full set of key bindings

The presentation of results can be controlled by the following
variables.

:index:`notmuch-search-result-format`
    Control how each thread of messages is presented in the
    ``notmuch-show-mode`` buffer

:index:`notmuch-search-oldest-first`
    Display the oldest threads at the top of the buffer

It is also possible to customize how the name of buffers containing
search results is formatted using the following variables:

:index:`notmuch-search-buffer-name-format`
       |docstring::notmuch-search-buffer-name-format|

:index:`notmuch-saved-search-buffer-name-format`
       |docstring::notmuch-saved-search-buffer-name-format|


.. _notmuch-show:

notmuch-show
============

``notmuch-show-mode`` is used to display a single thread of email from
your email archives.

By default, various components of email messages, (citations,
signatures, already-read messages), are hidden. You can make
these parts visible by clicking with the mouse button or by
pressing RET after positioning the cursor on a hidden part.

``<space>``
    Scroll the current message (if necessary),
    advance to the next message, or advance to the next thread (if
    already on the last message of a thread).

``c``
    :ref:`show-copy`

``N``
    Move to next message

``P``
    Move to previous message (or start of current message)

``n``
    Move to next matching message

``p``
    Move to previous matching message

``+,-``
    Add or remove arbitrary tags from the current message.

``?``
    Display full set of key bindings

Display of messages can be controlled by the following variables

:index:`notmuch-message-headers`
       |docstring::notmuch-message-headers|

:index:`notmuch-message-headers-visible`
       |docstring::notmuch-message-headers-visible|

:index:`notmuch-show-header-line`
       |docstring::notmuch-show-header-line|

.. _show-copy:

Copy to kill-ring
-----------------

You can use the usually Emacs ways of copying text to the kill-ring,
but notmuch also provides some shortcuts. These keys are available in
:ref:`notmuch-show`, and :ref:`notmuch-tree`. A subset are available
in :ref:`notmuch-search`.

``c F``	``notmuch-show-stash-filename``
   |docstring::notmuch-show-stash-filename|

``c G`` ``notmuch-show-stash-git-send-email``
   |docstring::notmuch-show-stash-git-send-email|

``c I`` ``notmuch-show-stash-message-id-stripped``
   |docstring::notmuch-show-stash-message-id-stripped|

   |docstring::notmuch-show-stash-to|

``c ?``
    Show all available copying commands

.. _notmuch-tree:

notmuch-tree
============

``notmuch-tree-mode`` displays the results of a "notmuch tree" of your
email archives. Each line in the buffer represents a single
message giving the relative date, the author, subject, and any
tags.

``c``
    :ref:`show-copy`

``<return>``
   Displays that message.

``N``
    Move to next message

``P``
    Move to previous message

``n``
    Move to next matching message

``p``
    Move to previous matching message

``o`` ``notmuch-tree-toggle-order``
   |docstring::notmuch-tree-toggle-order|

``l`` ``notmuch-tree-filter``
   Filter or LIMIT the current search results based on an additional query string

``t`` ``notmuch-tree-filter-by-tag``
   Filter the current search results based on an additional tag


``g`` ``=``
    Refresh the buffer

``?``
    Display full set of key bindings

As is the case with :ref:`notmuch-search`, the presentation of results
can be controlled by the variable ``notmuch-search-oldest-first``.


Global key bindings
===================

Several features are accessible from anywhere in notmuch through the
following key bindings:

``j``
    Jump to saved searches using :ref:`notmuch-jump`.

``k``
    Tagging operations using :ref:`notmuch-tag-jump`

.. _notmuch-jump:

notmuch-jump
------------

Saved searches configured through :ref:`saved-searches` can
include a "shortcut key" that's accessible through notmuch-jump.
Pressing ``j`` anywhere in notmuch followed by the configured shortcut
key of a saved search will immediately jump to that saved search.  For
example, in the default configuration ``j i`` jumps immediately to the
inbox search.  When you press ``j``, notmuch-jump shows the saved
searches and their shortcut keys in the mini-buffer.

.. _notmuch-tag-jump:

notmuch-tag-jump
----------------

Tagging operations configured through ``notmuch-tagging-keys`` can
be accessed via :kbd:`k` in :ref:`notmuch-show`,
:ref:`notmuch-search` and :ref:`notmuch-tree`.  With a
prefix (:kbd:`C-u k`), notmuch displays a menu of the reverses of the
operations specified in ``notmuch-tagging-keys``; i.e. each
``+tag`` is replaced by ``-tag`` and vice versa.

:index:`notmuch-tagging-keys`

  |docstring::notmuch-tagging-keys|

Buffer navigation
=================

:index:`notmuch-cycle-notmuch-buffers`
   |docstring::notmuch-cycle-notmuch-buffers|

Configuration
=============

.. _importing:

Importing Mail
--------------

:index:`notmuch-poll`
   |docstring::notmuch-poll|

:index:`notmuch-poll-script`
   |docstring::notmuch-poll-script|

Sending Mail
------------

:index:`mail-user-agent`

       Emacs consults the variable :code:`mail-user-agent` to choose a mail
       sending package for commands like :code:`report-emacs-bug` and
       :code:`compose-mail`.  To use ``notmuch`` for this, customize this
       variable to the symbol :code:`notmuch-user-agent`.

Init File
---------

When Notmuch is loaded, it will read the ``notmuch-init-file``
(``~/.emacs.d/notmuch-config`` by default) file. This is normal Emacs Lisp
file and can be used to avoid cluttering your ``~/.emacs`` with Notmuch
stuff. If the file with ``.elc``, ``.elc.gz``, ``.el`` or ``.el.gz``
suffix exist it will be read instead (just one of these, chosen in this
order). Most often users create ``~/.emacs.d/notmuch-config.el`` and just
work with it. If Emacs was invoked with the ``-q`` or ``--no-init-file``
options, ``notmuch-init-file`` is not read.
