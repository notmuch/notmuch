.TH NOTMUCH-RESTORE 1 2012-06-01 "Notmuch 0.13.2"
.SH NAME
notmuch-restore \- Restores the tags from the given file (see notmuch dump).

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B "notmuch restore"
.RB [ "--accumulate" ]
.RI "[ <" filename "> ]"

.SH DESCRIPTION

Restores the tags from the given file (see
.BR "notmuch dump" ")."

The input is read from the given filename, if any, or from stdin.

Note: The dump file format is specifically chosen to be
compatible with the format of files produced by sup-dump.
So if you've previously been using sup for mail, then the
.B "notmuch restore"
command provides you a way to import all of your tags (or labels as
sup calls them).

The --accumulate switch causes the union of the existing and new tags to be
applied, instead of replacing each message's tags as they are read in from the
dump file.

See \fBnotmuch-search-terms\fR(7)
for details of the supported syntax for <search-terms>.

.B "notmuch restore"
updates the maildir flags according to tag changes if the
.B "maildir.synchronize_flags"
configuration option is enabled. See \fBnotmuch-config\fR(1) for
details.
