I saw the LWN article and decided to take a look at notmuch.  I'm
currently using mutt and mairix to index and read a collection of
Maildir mail folders (around 40,000 messages total).

notmuch indexed the messages without complaint, but my attempt at
searching bombed out. Running, for example:

  notmuch search storage

Resulted in 4604 lines of errors along the lines of:

  Error opening
  /home/lars/Mail/read-messages.2008/cur/1246413773.24928_27334.hostname,U=3026:2,S:
  Too many open files

I'm curious if this is expected behavior (i.e., notmuch does not work
with Maildir) or if something else is going on.

Cheers,

  Is the list archived anywhere?  The obvious archives
  (http://notmuchmail.org/pipermail/notmuch/) aren't available, and I
  think I subscribed too late to get the patch (I only just saw the
  discussion about it).

  It doesn't look like the patch is in git yet.

    The version of lib/messages.cc in your repo doesn't build because it's
    missing "#include <stdint.h>" (for the uint32_t on line 466).
