    The version of lib/messages.cc in your repo doesn't build because it's
    missing "#include <stdint.h>" (for the uint32_t on line 466).

 Welcome, Lars!

 I hadn't even seen that Keith's blog post had been picked up by lwn.net.
 That's very interesting. So, thanks for coming and trying out notmuch.

 Sadly, the lwn article coincided with me having just introduced this
 bug, and then getting on a Trans-Atlantic flight. So I fixed the bug
 fairly quickly, but there was quite a bit of latency before I could push
 the fix out. It should be fixed now.

 Notmuch works just fine with maildir---it's one of the things that it
 likes the best.

 Happy hacking,
