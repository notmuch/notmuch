I saw the announcement this morning, and was very excited, as I had been
hoping sup would be turned into a library,
since I like the concept more than the UI (I'd rather an emacs interface).

I did a preliminary compile which worked out fine, but
sysconf(_SC_SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX) returns -1 on
FreeBSD, so notmuch_config_open segfaulted.

Attached is a patch that supplies a default buffer size of 64 in cases where
-1 is returned.

http://www.opengroup.org/austin/docs/austin_328.txt - seems to indicate this
is acceptable behavior,
and
http://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-bugs/2006/06/07/msg016808.htmlspecifically
uses 64 as the
buffer size.
