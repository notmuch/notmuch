OVERVIEW					*notmuch-intro*

This is a vim plug-in that provides a fully usable mail client interface,
utilizing the notmuch framework.

It has three main views: folders, search, and thread. In the folder view you
can find a summary of saved searches, In the search view you can see all the
threads that comprise the selected search, and in the thread view you can read
every mail in the thread.

==============================================================================
USAGE						*notmuch-usage*

To use it, simply run the `:NotMuch` command.

By default you start in the folder view which shows you default searches and
the number of threads that match those:
>
	10 new                  (tag:inbox and tag:unread)
	20 inbox                (tag:inbox)
	30 unread               (tag:unread)
<
You can see the threads of each by clicking `enter`, which sends you to the
search view. In both the search and folder views you can type `s` to type a
new search, or `=` to refresh. To see a thread, type `enter` again.

To exit a view, click `q`.

Also, you can specify a search directly:
>
	:NotMuch is:inbox and date:yesterday..
<

CONFIGURATION					*notmuch-config*

You can add the following configurations to your `.vimrc`, or
`~/.vim/after/plugin/notmuch.vim`.

						*g:notmuch_folders*

The first thing you might want to do is set your custom searches.
>
	let g:notmuch_folders = [
		\ [ 'new', 'tag:inbox and tag:unread' ],
		\ [ 'inbox', 'tag:inbox' ],
		\ [ 'unread', 'tag:unread' ],
		\ [ 'to-do', 'tag:to-do' ],
		\ [ 'to-me', 'to:john.doe and tag:new' ],
		\ ]
<

						*g:notmuch_custom_search_maps*
						*g:notmuch_custom_show_maps*

You can also configure the keyboard mappings for the different views:
>
	let g:notmuch_custom_search_maps = {
		\ 't':		'search_tag("+to-do -inbox")',
		\ 'd':		'search_tag("+deleted -inbox -unread")',
		\ }

	let g:notmuch_custom_show_maps = {
		\ 't':		'show_tag("+to-do -inbox")',
		\ 'd':		'show_tag("+deleted -inbox -unread")',
		\ }
<

						*g:notmuch_date_format*

To configure the date format you want in the search view:
>
	let g:notmuch_date_format = '%d.%m.%y'
<

						*g:notmuch_datetime_format*

You can do the same for the thread view:
>
	let g:notmuch_datetime_format = '%d.%m.%y %H:%M:%S'
<

						*g:notmuch_folders_count_threads*

If you want to count the threads instead of the messages in the folder view:
>
	let g:notmuch_folders_count_threads = 1
<

						*g:notmuch_reader*
						*g:notmuch_sendmail*

You can also configure your external mail reader and sendmail program:
>
	let g:notmuch_reader = 'mutt -f %s'
	let g:notmuch_sendmail = 'sendmail'
